I usually go in knowing my first set is going to be more mellow vibes and usually by the end of it people are lifted a bit. Second set is when I can usually see people cut loose a little more. Sometimes it’s faster and first set is raging. I played a restaurant gig recently and while there was scattered applause most of the show when I announced I was finished I got a big round of applause. Sometimes people are trying to be polite to other patrons too, they don’t really want to applaud every couple minutes while eating or whatever. I try to not take anything personally and focus on how I can get the most emotion and feeling out of what I’m doing.

* Find the table/group paying the most attention to you, and just talk to them. Crack jokes, tell stories, ask them for requests. Other groups will almost always start paying more attention.

* Introduce your songs/say ""thank you"" at the end of each song. Being conversational tends to get people to listen to you more closely. This feels awkward to do when they're not listening at the beginning, but it does help. 

* Turn up your volume. If you're in control of your own mix and you're adjusting from the stage, you've probably set the volume too low for the whole venue. Don't be afraid to turn up a bit louder than you think you need to. Trust me, if you're actually too loud someone will ask you to turn down, but they will almost never ask you to turn up. 

* Just play your best. Sometimes the crowd just doesn't care that you're there. Try to have fun, play some new songs, do some instrumental stuff. Keep a good attitude and do your thing.",37

A restaraunt crowd wants great background music that sets and elevates the mood, something that won't disturb the conversation but that they can tune into and enjoy whenever they want.

Tell stories about your music - audiences ALWAYS ask about the song with the story connected to it at the merch table

Audience interaction is my favorite damn part of playing onstage. There’s a difference between playing a SHOW and playing your music live.


Also, atmosphere is everything. If people didn’t sign up for a live music performance and they’re trying to eat their damn dinner before they go to a movie, they don’t owe you anything. You’re a jukebox. Play your songs, be prepared and professional, get paid and enjoy your free drink at the bar",4

xsz1nq,iqpfonf,SwellJoe,1664680615.0,"I once saw the Goo Goo Dolls in a tiny club in Houston. They were touring _A Boy Named Goo_, but before _Name_ exploded and made them the biggest rock band in the world for about 15 minutes. I was there to see a friend's band play, and was aware of the Goo Goo Dolls but not really a fan...most of the modest crowd was actually there for the local act, and most of the crowd left when they finished playing (another big show was happening that night that had all the buzz). So, it was me, the opening band and their girlfriends, and a dozen other people, tops, including bar staff, when the headliner took the stage. The crowd wasn't hostile, but the crowd wasn't exactly going crazy over the band, either...people played pool during the set, chatted, etc.

They still played like that show mattered. No punches were pulled. They played hard, did a full set, never said a negative word about the crowd, thanked the opening band by name, did all the usual ""tip your bartender"", ""thanks for coming out"", that sort of thing. And, they hung out after the show and had a couple beers and chatted with everybody that stuck around. Genuinely nice guys, self-deprecating about the crowd, and clearly had fun, anyway. They liked playing their music live, and it was OK if nobody else got it. Next time they came through town less than a year later, still touring _A Boy Named Goo_, they played the Summit (17,000 capacity).

I don't have any real concrete advice here, but I can say that a genuine love of being able to play live music for an audience shines through...they probably felt pretty bad about the turnout for that show, on the whole. But, my respect for them went through the roof.

If you don't love playing live music, don't. And, if you do love playing live music, act like it. If you've done the work, somebody will connect with what you're doing. You probably won't be playing a packed arena next year, but you might find a place in the scene you're in.",4

Draw them in.

You’ve spent all these years studying music ,buying great instruments, taking voice lessons etc.  how many years have you spent on studying the crowd? Reading about how to be a good front man, going out to the venues and watching people successfully engage? I worked for the one of the best front men in the country. He was 4’8” tall! We used to walk in the place and he would say” when I walk in there they’re all laughing at me; when I leave they all want to suck my cock” And it was true! Being next to him on stage for years taught me how to do my own front when I have my own band. It’s a skill unto itself. It’s not the crowd is receptive or unreceptive; it’s how YOU interact with THEM.not vice versa. When I have my own band  and I’m working with my musicians and after a few songs we were getting nothing I’ll tell them “don’t worry about it ;pick one person in the audience make eye contact; ; flirt with them. “ I also spent a lot of time working up dialogue.

xsz1nq,iqspp5m,Fat_tata,1664742507.0,"Depends on the venue and the style of music you’re playing. You mentioned dinner - if you’ve got a restaurant gig you need to try to actively greet all the people that are there, you’re gonna be the glue that binds that entire room together. Keep an eye out for people who have wine or cocktails, they are going to help you engage because booze makes people fun. Ask them what they’re drinking, ask them to sing along in the chorus. Don’t start all at once, build up to it. Dance a little, throw some curve balls, drop your shaker, draw some attention to yourself and laugh and have a good time.  

But don’t expect because you can play guitar that everybody needs to listen to you or enjoy your music… chances are there are some musicians in the room with you who can play better. That’s not really the point, the point is to break down the social barriers, and the ice. So be extroverted, but not annoying. Greet people as they come in, start a conversation with somebody during your set, ask them what there favorite thing is.. (don’t ask them if they enjoy the music, that leaves the door open for a negative feedback, you want a positive feedback loop).

Last night I played a gig where some guy from a little covers band in Brisbane was in the audience and he put on an absolute masterclass on things that get the crowd into it. It was insane, he was like my hype man for the night.

Some of it was awkward, he was running around telling everyone who I am, that I'm great and they should come listen. I won't be doing that about myself.

He did some shout-outs on the mic (I let him), praising the staff, praising the chefs, thanking people for coming out, all the usual stuff we should be doing. I will be incorporating this into it.

He did shout-outs to me and my own social media stuff - awkward for me but I will be doing this in-between songs every now and then because I am on Spotify and YT etc etc.. just felt like a super useful thing to do.

He did a lot of things that seem so basic but incredibly useful for audience interaction and engagement.

He also told me at his own gigs, before he plays, he puts business cards on every table, introduces himself to people if they're there and says they do private events too. Then, on his breaks he never sits around, he does the business cards on tables thing and introduces himself to people.

Some people have the gift of the gab, and some of us musos need to work on it because that networking and hypey aspect is ridiculously important when it comes to getting people engaged and into what you're doing.


I've got a little light-up sign with my name on it that's helped engagement massively. People just knowing my name helps because sometimes they'll call out my name or whatever and it's all interaction, any interaction at all can turn into positive vibes for a long time after.

xsz1nq,iqqfdrc,Hounmlayn,1664706211.0,"Where are you playing? That is the ONLY question you need to ask yourself when preparing for a gig.

A dinner? Play more relaxing music. Softer music with a few climaxes in them. Not too loud where they can't hear their own conversations, but loud enough that if a sentimental song comes on for anyone, they can stop and appreciate it.

A club? Hype and energy are king. Maybe a slower song every hour to give people who refuse to leave the dancefloor a rest, before you put on a current charter or a classic banger, depending on the age of the audience.

A work event? Just play charts, past and present. The easiest gigs you'll ever do.

You don't always need people to be shaking their bits on the dancefloor. Just make sure your music fits the vibe first. If they like the music, you will get repeat gigs.",1
xsz1nq,iqqoeco,VanVandal,1664712757.0,"Back in my days when I was playing in a metal band, our first gigs were really awkard. People were just standing, looking and judging you. I think it's mainly because they just don't know your music, they don't know what to expect and how to react. But if you're good (or at least decent) it gets better with every gig. You start collecting crowd that is present on your every gig and they start having fun, because they know your music. This crowd gets bigger and bigger and believe me, you may miss that part where 20 people standing still grows into a 500-700 crowd shouting your (or the band's) name.",1

xsz1nq,iqpk0tu,GortheMusician,1664683098.0,"Legitimately the best advice. I find this when busking; when I'm vibing and enjoying the songs and am in the moment the coins start flying, but as soon as I'm anxious or looking for how people are reacting etc. that energy just emanates. 

It's a hard thing to control if you're nervous, but the best thing to do if you can't quite get in the zone is choose somewhere behind the crowd to look while playing and stare at it. I find an exit sign, neon light, or wall hanging are good focus points. When busking I'll just stare at a random shop front.

Basically, the audience wants to look at you, but they don't want to be looked at. Music is still performance and you should only break the 4th wall by choice by (as mentioned above) choosing a table to interact with, or having some go to jokes (can tune a guitar, can't tuna fish). It's the difference between Deadpool monologuing directly down a camera and an amateur actor accidentally glancing at that same camera by accident.

xsz1nq,iqnwpml,WordsThatEndInWord,1664654562.0,"Second this advice. It's honestly the only way.

(A table of white boomers walk in wearing baseball swag? Get your 'Sweet Caroline' on STAT) 

Find one table to connect with to start and stay with them their entire visit. If they're clapping the whole time or interacting with you, that's the stuff. That'll help you practice",52

But OP is trying crowd to work and bar owners are asking them to engage with the audience more. That means whatever they are trying isn’t working.  That’s off the cuff non rehearsed and probably is not connecting with the audience.  


When I say rehearse I didn’t say write it line for line, but being practiced talking to a crowd, knowing what your goals are is rehearsing. 


I want to thank the venue/other bands/ bartender at the intro of song 3.  I am changing instruments / tuning at song six, this is where I need to engage with the closest table or largest group.  You can rehearse speaking to a crowd without doing the “how’s everybody feeling tonight” trope.  


Remember, OP is being asked to engage better.  The only way to get better is through doing it more and more.  Rehearsal means confidence.  It doesn’t mean a word for word script. 

They’ll eventually get there where it will be off the cuff but they need somewhere to start.  If you’re not good at something, practice and rehearse.  That’s life in general.",6
