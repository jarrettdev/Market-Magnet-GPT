123sqys,jdw3puf,LetterheadNo1752,1679936332.0,">Our plan was to follow the conventional wisdom of only performing them once they're out,

What's the logic behind this conventional wisdom?

Personally, as a solo singer-songwriter, I couldn't imagine hiding my work under a bushel like that. When I write a song that I'm proud of, I can't wait to share it, and it goes straight onto my setlist. If anything, I feel like my songs aren't ready to be recorded until I've played them on stage at least a dozen times.",173
123sqys,jdwhjko,X_PRSN,1679941591.0,"Jane's Addiction was known for taking their new material on the road before recording. Their rationale was that by performing the songs regularly, they'd go through a more rigorous development process and be much more well-refined for the album.

I consider this a very good philosophy, and I'm very sure more than a few large bands to this as well. I highly encourage you to tour your new material, man, and have fun with it!",83
123sqys,jdw671j,,1679937279.0,"There is an astounding amount of needless overthinking in your post. Play what you want to play. Do your more well known songs to satisfy fans, and do new songs to promote the album. Or whatever you want I don't know man. If you feel like playing the old album in its entirety, okay. If you feel like playing the new album in its entirety, okay.

The real conventional wisdom is to do what you feel like you're doing lol. I have no idea what conventional wisdom you're talking about because I've never heard that until now.",59

They would play songs live, do home demos, then do studio demos, then play them live a bit more, then make the actual record. Sometimes they’d re-record the record if it wasn’t good enough. 

If you feel you have to get them down, make a demo. Finesse it, then make the record.",31

123sqys,jdwqp5c,nicegh0st,1679945058.0,"Yeah in any band I’ve been a part of, we always put our best “new” songs in the set list. This way, we could build fan memories with those songs at shows before they can even go listen to them, thus building excitement for upcoming releases. It’s also great if the song hasn’t been recorded yet - getting a few live run-throughs in will really help the studio tracking/production go waaaay better.

That being said, it's good to open/close on songs people recognize.",5
123sqys,jdwiugn,skrelnitz,1679942087.0,"Definitely. I’ve done this in several bands across multiple genres. Usually just one or two new ones per set. Use playing the songs live as sort of an experiment, see which of the new ones people respond to. If people don’t respond, what can you change to make the song better? Should you just drop this song entirely? It’s great immediate feedback on where your sound is heading.",6
123sqys,jdwom3c,kokoraskrasatos,1679944271.0,"I'd say play a part of it, as a teaser sort of thing. My reasoning is this: 

If you are part of an active live music scene, you probably play at least some shows together with other bands, who have their own following, and their following does not necessarily keep up with your work. So by playing some stuff live (and presuming they like what they hear) you bring more attention to your release. This is especially true if playing opening acts for bigger bands, who will by definition have a bigger following.

Mostly though, as a show goer, I love listening to the new/unreleased stuff. It makes the whole experience more direct for me, in the sense that I feel more connected to what the band is doing, see more of their thought process and also get a bit of a nice surprise. Even songs that you ultimately decide not to put in an album but kinda like are imo good live material, brings something new to the table and adds one more reason to go to the shows.

Last but reaaaally not least is, do what you feel is better/more creative/more fun. Promotion and managing and all that is fine and good, but mate you're playing music here. It's art, do what feels best for your art.",5
123sqys,jdwyqph,computerface9000,1679948137.0,My take is that you should always play your absolute strongest material - it’s okay if the crowd can’t go home and download the songs yet because if they enjoyed the performance they will likely follow you on social media and check out the songs once they are released,5

Those kinds of experiences stick with fans, I’ll always remember hearing “Nod Off” before it was officially released, and I think you should take this aspect into consideration. If you have a fan base then they will consider it a privilege to be one of the first people to hear unreleased material.",4
123sqys,jdww3nt,artemus_who,1679947124.0,I'd say you want to play your stuff live in the same way comedians will test out new material and let it naturally evolve before finally recording it. That's how I approach it anyway,3
123sqys,jdwybaj,shredward81,1679947972.0,"I can think of several instances of bands playing unreleased material to hype up their release. Unless you are playing enough shows to where the audience would get tired of the new material, I don’t see how it could hurt at all. To be honest I’ve never heard that you shouldn’t, I always thought that playing it live first was the conventional wisdom!",3

123sqys,jdx6xrj,Austin_Is_Yearning,1679951286.0,"I've seen pretty successful bands grow from a niche genre local following at least a couple times. One in particular would start playing 2-3 songs from their newer stuff before it was ever released, or sometimes recorded. With an engaged fanbase, this can help build up the anticipation of the possibilities for the new album. If they're really engaged, you might end up seeing some live version go up on their social media or youtube.  


I loved when the bands did this, and also noticed that playing it live helped them experiment and hammer out kinks in the song so when they recorded it was different than the initial live version and better. I also saw a SASAMI interview recently where she talked about touring from her first album and all the songs got darker and edgier as the tour went on. So then the next album that came out had much more edge to it. It can go both ways, but as long as you pick a method that works for your bands goals, I think you'll be fine.  


Personally, I'd try to put on killer shows with these opportunities you have. You might be able to land someone even better at production to produce the album for you this way, and it shows the other bands and crowds where you're going. Way more likely to get buy in from everyone involved this way, IMO.",3

I remember Peter Gabriel back when he went on tour with Genesis to support their record The lamb lies down on broadway before it’s release. The album is awesome but Peter said it was met coldly by the crowd because it was with the new material. And to my experience it is the same for me and live music I hear - if I liked the song prior to hearing it live and listened to it multiple times then it is a better experience for me.",2

If you’re bored playing old material, your audience will pick up on that and instinctively become less interested. Play what you love, with passion, and accept whatever results come from that.

Here’s the thing that most of us won’t usually recognize or admit: a very large percentage of the people who see us perform do not really care about us or our music at all beyond what is right in front of them. People come to see a band to be in a moment in time, and aren’t typically invested in that act beyond that moment. So, if you want to wow an audience and make some of them care about what you are doing beyond that moment, you have to put on a great show, which means performing your best material in the best way that you can, every time you play. 

This also doesn’t negate what you’ve done before, even if the material as it’s recorded is less interesting. Create new arrangements of the songs to keep them fresh. Your old fans will appreciate it, and any new audiences will appreciate the passion you are expressing from enjoying what you are doing on stage.

I think as a new band/growing band, really important to provide a variety of both old and new- both for the opportunity you mentioned of you can go listen to this here- but also for collecting data like emails for future releases.

Like if you're one of many acts and the vast majority of the people in attendance are getting their first exposure to you, play whatever you want. That's your chance to make an impression.  


If you're a well-established band and at (or near) the top of the bill and a significant portion of the crowd is there to see YOU, then they're there to hear songs that they already love. Play one or two new ones for sure depending on how long your set is, but as a fan if I'm going to see a band I love and I'm not very familiar with the set I'm going to be pretty disappointed. Call me entitled, whatever, but looking at it from a consumer perspective I'd bet most people feel the same way.

In fact, playing something they like that they have to wait a bit to hear again can drive further engagement with your existing content. If I know an artist is going to be releasing something I'll like in the future I'm much more likely to follow them on social media for instance, so I know as soon as it's out. In the process I'm going to see more of their content and probably listen to what's already available more than I otherwise would have.

There's a reason bands are always teasing upcoming content, and why it's very common for a band to play a song they haven't released yet - it's to keep you hungry for more, which is the guiding principle of marketing. Marketing isn't just about shoving your stuff in people's faces constantly, it's about making fans want to seek it out themselves.

Some songs take me a good five or six listens to fully process and form an opinion on. 

But I’d imagine this varies wildly between genres and crowds. Like if you’re a club/bar type band and your job is play music people will dance to, then yeah crowd reaction a good indicator if everyone walks out.

Most of the bands I like have a lot going on musically and have very underwhelming crowd reactions when debuted live because people don’t know the songs and are mostly just trying to process it. Or they were just singing along to the last song and aren’t as excited cause they don’t know the words/have any feelings attached to this new one.

Anyways, I didn’t mean for this to be so long-winded! I guess my point is crowd reaction on first listen isn’t always a good test and if you and your band all think the song smacks, roll with it and give it some time to marinate and grow on your fans.",1
