xtwwcg,iqt47zl,socialistwerker,1664748176.0,"I don‚Äôt like a lot of his content, but I do agree with Finn McKinty (aka the Punk Rock MBA on YouTube) about content creation. Social media isn‚Äôt going to help you if it‚Äôs just the same old shit as every other band or artist. If you‚Äôre just posting a basic stuff like:

* Check out our new single / video on Spotify / YouTube!
* So stoked for our upcoming show at \[venue\] in \[city\]! Link to TicketMaster or Facebook Event page.
* Killer set from \[other band at my gig I‚Äôm playing\]!
* Check our new \[t-shirts or merch\]!
* We‚Äôre in the studio working on new material!

‚Ä¶ then very few people are going to engage with your band‚Äôs social media. And if nobody is engaging, then fewer people are going to see it. Which keeps your social media stuck in the content graveyard. People aren‚Äôt going to be excited by boring, half-assed self promotion. 

If your social media is going to do something, then it needs to have its own ‚Äúhook‚Äù just like any song or video or tv series or movie. There are multiple ways to find your own social media niche or hook. If you‚Äôre good looking, it could be something as simple as thirst trap pics and vids. If you‚Äòre rich or lead an exciting life, it could be life style stuff. Watch me drive a Lamborghini, or check out this fancy hotel, or photos with other famous people, etc. If you‚Äôve got strong feelings on politics, or if you‚Äôre full of drama and like to stir shit, it could mean shit posting on Twitter. But so long as your niche is genuine and interesting, it will drive engagement, therefore it could be an asset to your music. But if it‚Äôs just the same old shit as everyone else, then you might as well not bother.",129
xtwwcg,iqszhg0,SR_RSMITH,1664746287.0,"Well I‚Äôm a hobbyist so I worried about this matter about 15 seconds and then shrugged. I enjoy making music and I don‚Äôt expect it to return the investment in instruments or plugins. I just happen to enjoy it. I‚Äôve published in YouTube/ Spotify about 20 songs and I‚Äôve got like 200 views of each on YT and 16 monthly listeners on Spotify. I may buy some ads at some point in FB or IG, fully knowing it‚Äôs a vanity thing, so I‚Äôm at peace with myself. I may try Reverbnation or Bandcamp but honestly it sounds like too much work for a handful of listeners.

Soon I‚Äôll order about 50 Cds (I know, a dead format) to sell personally to friends and acquaintances. It will take a few years but I trust I‚Äôll sell them all. So I‚Äôll keep it a hobby and I‚Äôll just have fun.",54

xtwwcg,iqunldf,kintsuku_music,1664775619.0,I think it's definitely better to focus your time and energy on creating the best music you can first and foremost. Sure posting on tiktok and insta might help you reach more people but never let the pressure and focus of creating short form quick disposable content drain your time and energy from making your best work. If you feel you have the time and motivation to create social media posts then I think it's always worth a shot because we all know how it feels to shout into the void so my vote goes to experimenting with all the tools that are available to reach more people. But never forgetting to prioritise the quality of your music,3
xtwwcg,iqviho9,ApexInfenergy,1664799946.0,Honestly if your playing shows frequently in a city with a good scene you don't need any social media.

xtwwcg,iqu2nj9,upliftingart,1664763567.0,"I think the question is flawed as the definition of ""successful"" musician determines the answer

xtwwcg,iqvhcd4,Za1bah,1664799302.0,"I think with a lot of these things, it depends on what kind of music you're making. Each social media platform has a particular type of audience on it. If that audience doesn't match your audience, you're going to have a bad time.

I also think that these platforms are oversaturated with musicians. My Instagram (which I don't really use any more) has a situation where most of the followers are musicians and most of their followers are the same musicians. It's like all salesmen, no customers.

It's the early adopters who did well out of these things. There's no point in copying them directly. I guess we have to be on the lookout for the next big thing and become the early adopters of that. I mean, slept on tiktok for ages because it seemed cringe. I should have jumped on it early.

I think the issue is that once it becomes ""advice"" that effectively means by definition it's oversaturated.",2

As someone said here already, Tik Tok gives you lots of reach quickly if you stay consistent and flexible (paraphrase).

If you want real audience growth without a budget Id say: Tik Tok, Reels, YT shorts. But honestly don‚Äôt overcomplicate it. Just post 3x a day videos that look like viral videos.

TikTok is still relatively new and will provide the best growth for creators. 

Social Media companies have to provide value to users when they begin. They do this by giving everyone the serotonin boosts they need by giving them views and followers. After a bit they make it so you get less views and followers, then you chase that high that you had before.

xtwwcg,iqwomzi,socialistwerker,1664817896.0,"Those are just easy examples. If you had a successful YouTube channel doing guitar lessons or gear reviews, you could leverage that. But if don't already have an established channel doing those lessons or gear reviews, it's already a pretty crowded space. You would need to offer something unique, and building your channel becomes just as much of a slog as promoting your brand. 

If you had a thousand followers on Twitch or Discord streaming video game stuff, you could leverage that, but there might not be a lot of overlap with your two audiences. The people who stream your gaming content might have different musical tastes, unless your music is also gaming-related (i.e. you stream Legend of Zelda games on Twitch, and you write Zelda-inspired prog rock music). 

The idea is that your social media content has to be original, has to be something that people would follow and consume on its own. It needs to offer something more than what fans already have from your album or whatever. If your music was already established, and already so popular and amazing that you had millions of fans purely from your music, then you wouldn't need any social media. You could totally abstain and still rake in the streams the album sales the touring revenue, etc. If your music is still a relative unknown for most people, and you want to use social media as a promotional tool, then that social media has to generate its own heat, its own fandom. So it's got to be more than ads for your music, your upcoming shows, your merch, etc.

Even if I really like an artist, like Nine Inch Nails, basic self-promotion isn't going to generate a lot of engagement from me. Like if I see a bunch of tour dates that are nowhere near me, it does nothing for me. Or if you're a local band in my area that plays local shows 2-3 times a month, I'm probably going to ignore most of those event posts. If I've seen your local band 3 times already, I'm probably not coming out on a random Thursday to see the same set again. I'm probably only coming out if we're close friends and you've sent me a text, given me a call to drag me out of the house.

Or on the slightly nerdier side of things, djent / prog metal bands like Periphery, Animals as Leaders, or Dance Gavin Dance probably owe their relative success to their connection with guitar forums and guitar nerds on the internet.

xtwwcg,iqt0x1x,DjayCas,1664746843.0,Everyone thinks that every viral TikTok song comes from ass shaking and somehow promoting your music there makes you less of a musician/professional but most of the songs that have blown up from tiktok just use relatable scenarios and jokes. fully clothed adults just adding a dad joke over your music on tiktok will change your life.,20
xtwwcg,iqun4j8,yummyyummybrains,1664775280.0,"With the sheer volume of users on TikTok, boiling it down to that single thing is overly reductive, and belies your ignorance of marketing.  It is merely a channel through which to connect with an audience.  There are *all kinds* of demographics and interests represented there.  Just like Insta, or FB, or Reddit, or...

Lack of success is a lack of imagination, in many cases.",4

But to get anyone to even care enough to check it out I have to hone an almost entirely separate craft. If I wanted to be a social media ""influencer"" or ""content creator"" I would have set out to do that from the jump.",3
xtwwcg,irb3mni,ChiefBullshitOfficer,1665078363.0,Your examples all used social media as an engagement tool but I don't see how they had to carve out some other niche skill? Like Justin Bieber and screamo bands doesn't use tutorials or crazy political opinions to drive engagement right?,3
xtwwcg,iqvnt43,johncookmusic,1664802722.0,"This might be true for some, but I was scrolling last night to do some research on what was working for other people, and all except a handful of the #songwriter videos I watched were pretty girls in their 20s playing mediocre slow songs. 

Videos are about eye candy, and it's easier if you ARE the eye candy. 

Not trying to be sexist - the same is true on the male side, catering to female audiences too. Big pecs and a six pack makes you more marketable than a dad bod and a bad haircut.",2

To your other point, I'm late 30s and Tik Tok is often talked about within my friend group and at meetings I go to for my day job. It's not just teens.",1
xtwwcg,irbfvue,socialistwerker,1665083356.0,"It‚Äòs either that or hit the birth lottery, be born into a celebrity family with connections in the industry, like Willow and Jaden Smith.

I‚Äôm not saying this is fair or good or anything like that. I‚Äôm reiterating a point made by someone else (ie the Punk Rock MBA), that there is no point in posting uninspired, half-assed social media to promote your band. If you‚Äôre going to bother doing social media to promote your band, then it has to be interesting. It has to be something people would check out on its own, and it‚Äôs got to have a reasonable crossover appeal with your music. Ie posting cute cat videos or cake recipes probably isn‚Äôt the correct approach for your technical death metal band.

There was a story a few months ago about how Halsey wanted to release a new single, but her label wouldn‚Äôt make it happen UNLESS she made a TikTok that got 5000 views or something. And Halsey is a successful popstar, she‚Äôs been signed to a major label for a decade. Record labels don‚Äôt want to promote artists anymore. Concert promoters and venues don‚Äôt want to promote shows and tours anymore. Everyone still wants their slice of the pie, but they want the artist to do ALL the work now. It‚Äòs not good or fair, but it‚Äôs the state things are in.",3
xtwwcg,iqwj5is,DjayCas,1664815785.0,"Have you ever searched the hashtag #songwriter to find new music to enjoy?  
I haven't. I doubt I ever will. You definitely trust your best friends to suggest new songs over some hashtag.  


TLDR:   
TikTok is just where people are watching videos today and every day people are goofy, sad, horny, happy, lonely and a million other things.   
The best performing videos are just relatable scenarios or jokes.   
Stuff you want to show your friends like   
""LOL this is you after 1 shot of vodka"",  
 ""Your brother acts just like this"",  
 ""I gotta get my dog a bowtie like that!"".  
It's just every day life set to music.  
You don't need double Ds or a 6 pack, you just need personality.

&#x200B;

  
Here's an independent/non major label example. Can easily be replicated by someone with NO budget.

  
A producer named Vano 3000 made a beat called ""Running Away"". 

  
He films himself walking around NY and the local Spider-Man cosplayer isn't in the mood to be filmed. Spider-Man's head shaking disapproval reminded Vano 3000 of old Adult Swim commercials so he added the logo and the video blew up.    
It becomes ""The Adult Swim Challenge"". Hundreds of thousands of people join in making their own Adult Swim style ads using his beat bringing in 62 million Spotify streams for some random bedroom beatmaker who doesn't even show his face in the video.  
 Just be yourself online, talk about things you actually care about and post often.   
Something will catch.",1

xtwwcg,irbrjq1,ChiefBullshitOfficer,1665088245.0,"I'm not gonna lie there's some hilarity behind cute kitten videos with technical death metal as background music ü§£ (band name idea: Death Kitten?)

But yeah i understand, it's just frustrating and I guess I'm just venting because the thing I love to do has been devalued to such an extent. It even frustrates me sometimes how lazy people are with music as well. Like most of my friends and family don't ""actively"" seek out new music they just take what is shoved in their face by an algo.

Also that Halsey thing is wild had no idea large artists like that were facing similar issues, makes me wonder why she's even with a label anymore (aside from being locked into a contract etc.)",2
xtwwcg,iqwpmaa,johncookmusic,1664818272.0,"I was looking for other songwriters to connect with. I'm relatively new to TikTok and just looking to test new hashtags. 

The phenomenon I describe is true everywhere though - social media, open mics, showcases, etc. If you're a good looking person, it's a LOT easier to get initial traction than if you're not. It doesn't always turn into engagement, but it's easier to get attention.",1
xtwwcg,irbtevl,socialistwerker,1665089043.0,"I think being a death metal musician would be a killer hook to promote your cute kitten videos or your cake recipes. I think your average person looking for cat videos or cake recipes would find that funny and it would make your cat or cake content stand out. I think that's reality TV 101. That's why there were so many reality shows about rough men: Ice Road Truckers, American Choppers and Monster Garage and all the motorcycle shows, Ink Master and all the tattoo shows, the Duck Dynasty guys, Sons of Guns and American Guns and all the gun shows, Pawn Stars, etc. That morbid curiosity about people who choose unusual lives.

I think the reverse does not work. Most people don't like death metal, so stumbling across a cute cat video or a great cake recipe is not going to entice those people to check out your death metal band.",2
xtwwcg,iqwr5w1,DjayCas,1664818862.0,"Well I mean that's just a fact of life. Sex sells. It always has.
