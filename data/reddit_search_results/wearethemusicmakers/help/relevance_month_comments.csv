11p3icc,jbw757t,TheYoungRakehell,1678596491.0,"I actually think what you're doing (working more in mono) is a great habit because it forces smarter arrangement and textural contrast.  

But panning is a tool and a dynamic one at that. Sometimes side elements can disappear and when they return, it feels like a major visceral lift to the song. Try things out, there is no right answer.",3
11p3icc,jbway4c,BarbersBasement,1678598820.0,Try this:   Take a song you have mixed in mono and create a new session.   Mix it in strict LCR.   Then create a new session of the same song and mix it again but go nuts with the panning.  Wait a day or two and then compare the three mixes.  Figure out what works for you and what doesn't.,3
11p3icc,jbw6uv7,Overth1nkingit,1678596319.0,"I don’t think there’s a right answer. If it works, it works. It is your art, your music. 

But i would also suggest trying it out, maybe you will like using it. Another tool in your arsenal. I generally like to use panning for movement and separation of sounds, but thats for my genre",2
11p3icc,jbw8ysi,MarcelDM,1678597588.0,"I mean you don't ""need"" panning but it creates more space and can help each sound have its own spot to shine.",2
11p3icc,jbxqqs5,JesusSwag,1678634467.0,"I haven't really used panning in 2-3 years now, with very few exceptions

I wouldn't say it's necessary, especially if you expect your music to be played on mono sources (like most phones or Bluetooth speakers)",2
11p3icc,jbzspk6,T444W,1678665815.0,You can also try focusing on stereo width. Keep kick drums and bass in the middle and expand guitars to the sides.,1
11p3icc,jc6wi8s,j_4m,1678803291.0,"I personally think that playing with the stereo field really adds to music. We experience the world in stereo, it offers a lot more creative control for the producer.",1
11p3icc,jbw8t46,Brinizle630,1678597492.0,"lmao nice I’m glad, and I never thought of using panning that way and it does seem quite useful/fun. Also I had another question if you don’t mind, generally what percent would you generally use when panning instruments?",1
11p3icc,jbwbm10,Brinizle630,1678599245.0,"this seems like a very good idea, I appreciate this thought. Thanks",1
11p3icc,jbw80ps,Brinizle630,1678597010.0,"fair point and I agree about it being our art so we should do what we want, if you don’t mind me asking what kind of music would u say u make? thanks.",2
11p3icc,jbw9pw4,Brinizle630,1678598053.0,"I see what you mean, and it can help add clarity I’m sure. I was in a tough spot because the entire internet is tryna convince me that if I don’t do this then my mix is gonna sound like flaming shit, imo the mix sounds find but I’m at like a cross roads wondering if when I add vocals and bass it’ll just sound like a mess and I’ll be forced to start panning my rhythm guitar.
Anyways, thanks.",1
11p3icc,jbw8mmb,Overth1nkingit,1678597381.0,I would say my music is something like progressive house. I like to have it evolve over time and i tend to like lots of movement too,2
11p3icc,jbw93d6,Brinizle630,1678597664.0,"ok that helps bring some more understanding to ur previous statement, I appreciate it.",2
