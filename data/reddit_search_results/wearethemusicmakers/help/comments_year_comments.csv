zcwlca,iyyts0a,willhamlink,1670215575.0,As someone who is a huge FL Studio fan I'd still say do another DAW. FL is great for beatmaking and MIDI work but it's not the greatest for recording live audio.,182
zcwlca,iyz4u0d,ZSymphonia,1670222918.0,"Reaper can be pretty overwhelming at first due to the insane amount of features and buttons it has, but honestly, most of those features aren't necessary for just recording audio, mixing and mastering it. Reaper can also be tried with all of its features for quite a long time (it's like WinRAR where it'll prompt you to pay every time you start it, but also won't force you) and I've heard from other people who have used FL Studio that recording many takes and comping them (choosing the best parts of each take to create a single track) is much easier in Reaper.

With that said, by watching this playlist of videos: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLM0xHqxaiT6-plorG47t3balft4nVki39 you're more than ready to tackle Reaper after messing around with it for a bit!",38

OP, just use Cakewalk. It's completely free, more than capable for what you told us about your wife's use case, and much more beginner-friendly than Reaper. I know that we mostly assume that spending more money will yield better results, but it's really not true in this case.",38

zcwlca,iyzlo2g,eXitse7en,1670237707.0,"Everyone is going to recommend the DAW that they personally use and many of them will try to convince you that it's the best. The truth is that, for the most part, they can all do the same things. Some are just a bit more specialized in certain areas. But the preference ultimately comes down to your workflow and how well you can intuit functionality based on their design and whether you personally resonate with that.

For these reasons, I would recommend Cakewalk. It is a full-featured DAW and is 100% free. You literally have nothing to lose.

I've used FL, Cubase, Reaper, Studio One... Probably more that I'm forgetting at the moment. Anyway, I use Cakewalk now, because it can do everything that those can do and it's free.",11
zcwlca,iz0808h,gsus_gon3r,1670251518.0,"You can always give Cakewalk a try, it’s been around for decades and has all the bells and whistles for the low price of free. It’s been my favorite for a while now.",6
zcwlca,iyzsyi3,TheProffalken,1670243272.0,"TL;DR: Use Cakewalk by Bandlab - it's free and will do everything you need, and I say this as someone who just bought a MIDI controller but until now has been recording guitars and vocals without issue.

Only thing I would advise is to get a decent audio interface.  This is something that will almost certainly start a holy war, but I love my Focusrite Scarlet Solo, and I can record via one microphone and one line-in at the same time which is perfect for my needs.  Larger versions with more inputs are available, but you may not need them.  I've included links in the stuff below.

I've written up my setup at [https://www.reddit.com/r/musicproduction/comments/yvchi3/an\_attempt\_at\_a\_guide\_to\_getting\_started\_for\_as/](https://www.reddit.com/r/musicproduction/comments/yvchi3/an_attempt_at_a_guide_to_getting_started_for_as/) but here's the bulk of that post:  

* [Cakewalk by Bandlab](https://www.bandlab.com/products/cakewalk) **FREE** \- it doesn't have some of the more advanced features of other DAWs, but it's free and it supports VST (Virtual Instruments) as well as MIDI controllers, and you can even add your tracks to videos via the basic video overlay stuff if that's your thing
* [Spitfire Audio LABS](https://labs.spitfireaudio.com/) **FREE** \- A good number of excellent instruments that you can use with ***any*** DAW that supports VST Plugins (which is all of the good ones, free and commercial!)
* [Spitfire Audio BBC Symphony Orchestra](https://www.spitfireaudio.com/bbc-symphony-orchestra-discover) **FREE** \- A complete Orchestra on your laptop, for free!
* A MIDI Controller **£75 - £1,000's depending on which model you get** - A bit like a piano or keyboard, these allow you to both play notes into the computer and control the DAW.  I've agonised for a long time over this and this week finally purchased a [Launchkey Mini MK3](https://novationmusic.com/en/keys/launchkey-mini) because it's powerful enough for the basic work that I'm doing whilst also portable enough to throw into my laptop bag for travelling.  The AKAI MPK mini is also a good product, I'm just worried that the joy sticks will snap off in my rucksack! :D
* Some kind of USB Audio Interface **£100 - £500 depending on model** - Soundcards in most laptops and PC's are rubbish and can't really do real-time audio, so this is where your Audio Interface comes in.  I've got a [Focusrite Scarlet Solo](https://focusrite.com/en/audio-interface/scarlett/scarlett-solo) which is more than enough for my needs.  I'm able to listen to everything I'm working on in my DAW and record both my voice and my guitar as well via the two inputs. (Cakewalk has some pretty decent guitar amp/fx sims in there for free as well, it really is a great tool even if it's looked down on by some!)
* Headphones **FREE - £100's depending on model** - Mine came with the Focusrite Solo, asking which brand is best is akin to asking which football team you should support, but Sennheiser generally do well in most reviews if you can't get the headphone bundle.
* Follow and watch most of [Guy Michaelmore's videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/ThinkSpaceEducation) on Youtube - his explanations ""just work"" for me, and it's far more fun than most other theory lessons I've had to sit through over the years!
* Once you're happy with your ability, check out [Charles Cornell](https://www.youtube.com/c/CharlesCornellStudios) and [Anne-Kathrin Dern](https://www.youtube.com/c/AnneKathrinDernComposer) to expand your knowledge",10
zcwlca,iyyu4sr,Solid_Recording_3601,1670215785.0,"As an instrumentalist who records direct into a DAW, I have found cakewalk to be more intuitive than Ableton. Audacity is also great for recording instruments intuitively. Ableton has some cool features for beat making, but cakewalk is easier for Intrumentalists",6
zcwlca,iyz1h74,SwellJoe,1670220495.0,"FL Studio could do it, but it isn't optimized for recording live music, quite far from it. I only use it for loop-oriented beat making. Unless she's planning on making EDM/synthwave/hip hop/etc., FL Studio isn't the best choice. It's great for a beginner in those genres, though, as the Producer edition comes with a great set of instruments and effects out of the box. You can make music immediately with it...but, you're gonna have to work harder to get real live instruments into it.

I use Reaper for recording real instruments, and I think it's marvelous. Very low resource usage, very high reliability, traditional recording studio workflow (which is a negative for some, but a positive for me), and has all the basics in terms of effects plugins included (but no instruments). And, only costs $60 for non-professional use, leaving a little money in your budget to pick up a VST or two (though nothing too expensive), if you did want some instruments. There are lots of very good free ones, though, too.

Ableton is pricey, but well-regarded. People who don't like a traditional recording studio workflow may prefer it, though reportedly folks have put effort into making a Reaper skin/plugin that makes it behave more like Ableton, making it similarly suitable for live performance and loop-based composition.",5

Studio one has a good mix of beginner friendly and powerful. It also comes with a few virtual instruments so you can play around with different sounds. Solid choice. 

Cubase is a solid daw as well. This is another good option. 

Pro tools is my own personal preference, but I wouldn't recommend it to beginners. It's expensive and doesn't come with many instruments. It's really catered to  recording and mixing professionals and is really good at that. For producers starting out, you can get a flying start somewhere else. 

Ableton live is a good daw, but since it has two modes, session and arrangement, it complicates things for beginners. Choose this only if you have a teacher or plan on reading up on how things are connected. This is a good alternative if she wants to do live dj sets or if she's planning on getting into sound art. 

Reaper is really powerful, but it doesn't force you into a workflow, so it has a really steep learning curve. It also doesn't come with many instruments. I love reaper, but I wouldn't recommend it to my students. Beware that if reaper fans made as much music as they engaged in flame wars, it would be the industry standard. 

FL is really good for pattern based beat making, but has a steep learning curve and is seriously behind the curve on recording. Wouldn't recommend it to your wife.

Just my two cents. Hope it helps.",6

I find it the best and fastest to use to audio recording and traditional mixing. Their suite of plug-ins is great; you don’t need anything else. And they even have a dedicated mastering tool. Reaper is incredible and cheap (possibly free) but it is NOT easy to learn and get the most out of. I also use Ableton a lot but it’s also a unique approach that might not align with a non-technical musician who just wants to lay down audio.,3

If you are not worried about the price, I 100% recommend Ableton. It's far more powerful than Studio One, so she has the potential to grow her skillset more. A lot more people use Ableton, so you will have a ton of community support on top of their in-house resources.

FL is a great DAW, but I do not think it fits her needs at all.

Pro Tools has a greater learning curve than Studio One, and it costs more. However, it is a powerful DAW just like Ableton. Pro Tools is more geared to studio recording than Ableton.

zcwlca,iz16rjm,eseffbee,1670265550.0,"Appreciate you've come here for DAW advice, but judging from your description of your wife's needs I would say that the principal equipment you need to think about is a good quality mic setup and good quality headphones.

Cheaping out on those thing complicates the DAW experience for newbies because they spend a lot of time trying to fix issues that should never have made it to the recording (noise, hiss, pops, poor/no stereo imaging, etc), or can't hear those issues in the case of headphones.

I would suggest avoiding all mics and headphones priced under $100 because they are poor value. If you can afford it then something like the Rode NT1 condenser mic is a fantastic choice for your wife's situation and an item you'll possibly never need to replace. The last thing you want to do is spend a not-insignificant sum on a mic that you quickly find is not quite good enough.

As someone who used Nero Soundtrax many years ago, I can say that practically any free DAW will serve the needs of someone doing simple (i.e. 1 or 2 input) live voice and instrument recording, which seems to be what your wife is interested in.

People commonly underestimate the importance of learning sound engineering for live musicians - stuff like mic placement, movement around the mic, plus take comping, editing and mixing.

DAWs with a huge amount of features may distract your wife from that primary task so beyond the capacity to use MIDI with a few decent (and free!) piano/organ VSTs, I wouldn't worry too much about the DAW.",3

Once you have Intro, there are reduced price upgrades to the full standard Ableton or the Suite version with all the instruments.

This dude set out to scientifically find out where the tone of a guitar comes from, great watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n02tImce3AE

Is it a terrible idea to think about building her one vs purchasing?

The guitar that I record with I bought for $70 from a pawn shop... also it's an entry level model. I spent more than double that on the pickups lol

As with any gift for a musician... musical instruments (including software and DAWs) are an intensely personal decision. Some of us are picky bitches

It's not super fun receiving a gift you won't use, or would feel pressured to use. With the guitar... I need something with a thin neck and 24 frets and I prefer a fixed bridge. She definitely should be part of the decision making process and if she doesn't know what she wants then she needs to go try some in person and see what feels good. Playing on fat necks is actually painful for me

Her style will dictate pickup choice

Once she has her initial setup and flow going, a weird/eclectic/vintage guitar pedal could be a good gift. Some guitarists don't use pedals but if it's unique then it's a cool conversation piece for the studio anyway",2

Reaper has a learning curve but it's full-featured and ~60 bucks (or free!) fir personal use.

 Cubase is my first love but it's more expensive. Look into the other versions for lower prices.

Cubase excels at midi VST instruments (pianos, drums). I found Reaper to be clunkier with them but that might be my ineptitude.

I recommend these two because you can record with time instead of a bpm which instrument players may need for tempo dynamics. Ableton, Reason and maybe FL prefer to have you stuck at one tempo unless you manually change it.

My vote: Reaper",2

I don’t have personal experience with Live but use Cubase and Bitwig. 

Cubase’s interface is a bit more traditional, and it can also output sheet music (you can even create parts in the note editor) so if she is able to read/write sheet music, this would be a major plus. It also has perhaps the best and most mature audio editing environment.

Bitwig has rock solid MIDI timing, the Grid is a great playground for experimental stuff, has similarities with Ableton Live (the developers are former Ableton employees), such as the clip launcher, automatic beat matching, etc.

FL is really great for playing around with soundscapes, combining effects and composing in the piano roll, but recording isn't its strength. However, the user interface looks far better than those of ProTools, Cubase or Ableton.

As someone who tried ProTools, Ableton, Cubase and Reaper as well: FL definitely was the best to start for me.

Also I think you're on the right path with the Producer Edition. I just want to mention that sometimes it can be way better to get a limiting version and not have too many choices in music making, as it forces you to tackle problems/ideas with more creativity instead of firing up the plugin that does it instantly.

What puts it behind other daws are comping features, editing tools and grouping. In some other daws, these three things are combined allowing for an advanced recording and editing workflow. Let's say you are recording drums, and you want to do 8 takes, do a comp between all the takes with crossfades and everything, and then lastly edit the toms by themself without the editing groups. This is easy peasy in pro tools. To my knowledge, not so much in FL. I could be wrong though. Would love to see an easy comping workflow in FL.

zcwlca,iyz2qm1,SwellJoe,1670221383.0,"How important is live recording to her goals? It sounded like from your description that'd be the most important part of it. If so, you need better than the mic input on the computer, and you need a better mic than what will plug into it.

A bunch of quite good, low cost, mics are on sale right now. You can get something that is quite good from reliable manufacturers for under $100. A large diaphragm condenser would be a good choice that works well on vocals and acoustic guitar.

While you can get microphones that plug directly into USB, including some pretty good and pretty cheap ones, I prefer to have a separate interface with at least two inputs, so I can record voice and guitar simultaneously without sync problems. Focusrite is good and cheap, but not quite cheap enough to fit into your budget.

Anyway, a computer mic input is going to be quite poor, tuned for speech and likely quite noisy, relatively speaking. And, you can pretty much only plug very bad microphones into it. If you want to get live sounds into a computer, the most important pieces are the transducer (the microphone), the room you're in, the preamp, and the ADC, probably in that order of importance, though any weak link in the chain results in a poor recording.

Edit: Also note that most little USB interfaces from e.g. PreSonus, Focusrite, or Steinberg, include either PreSonus Studio One Artist or Ableton Live Lite or Cubase LE, any of which good beginner DAWs sufficient for getting started (and probably better than FL Studio, if live music is important to her goals). PreSonus AudioBox 96 is two-channels, well-reviewed, and under $100. Leaving money in your budget for a microphone. I think that's your best bet, if I'm understanding what she wants to do.",5

By the way the trick to getting both ASIO and other sources to play at the same time is to set them both to the same sample rate and bit depth, otherwise ASIO will disable them and you can't do things like sing along to karaoke tracks or drum tracks found on YouTube.",5

Good heavens, so glad you specified.

The answer is no. A vocalist needs a sensitive condenser mic, a singer/songwriter needs two, and they need a two channel pre amp with a low noise floor.

A brass player needs a dynamic mic.

Anyone multi-tracking vocals or acoustic instruments needs studio headphones and a low latency audio interface.

A mixer/producer needs balanced studio monitors.

You can avoid the cost of three mics and a two channel interface and monitors and headphones by cheaping out and using an all-in-one USB mic, but the expense will be in recording quality and monitoring convenience",2

I started a similar journey last spring after having come back to guitar for a few years.  I ended up using Reaper for my DAW (I watched some getting started type videos on Ableton, too).  As others have mentioned there is a learning curve and you have to figure out the virtual instruments (LABS and Komplete Start, both free, for the biggest returns in terms of fun, IMHO), but if she's willing to put in the time and enjoy the sometimes slow/frustrating journey, Reaper is great.  (I can’t overstate how important the Kenny Gioia videos on the reaper website are.  Then if you need to drill down on anything you can find more specific videos on youtube.)  Ableton would probably be my pick for something easier, more plug and play, faster time-to-fun, but it's pricey.  Sometimes I think the easy paths / built-in workflows on something like Ableton that don't really exist on Reaper can be a bit limiting - you're not forced to color outside the lines as quickly.

Typically, drums are programmed using the piano roll and you can organize it in a way where you can mix each tom, cymbal, snare, kick, etc individually with control over attack and swing on each for variation, but I’m sure you know all of that.

FL Studio is perfect for bedroom recording artists that have a vocal mic and a DI line or mic for their instrument(s).  Lot of flexibility and control throughout the recording, mixing, and mastering process.  All at a price that won’t break the bank with free updates and new versions for the life of the product.  I don’t think there’s anything comparable out there for that niche.

I use a Fractal Audio FM3 for guitar and bass FX, and GGD for drums.
