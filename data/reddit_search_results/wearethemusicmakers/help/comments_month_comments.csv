I was twenty yrs old and in a funk so I brought up how I was in one. Cause my good friend/bandmate just Overdosed recently. Then time kinda ran out. And I realized he’s Paul mccartney, his bandmate was shot, his other bandmate dead.  And I’m complaining to Paul McCartney.. he was personable, present, attentive and open minded. I’m still not sure the moral. Maybe y’all can help me out. But I am certain at the age of 34 now, I’ve had that moment and many more. 

I feel like there are songs meant for sharing and some songs you write for yourself, and it’s still hard to curate what category each of them belong to, but you do your best.

I'm saying this because the negative criticism about Rick Rubin fits perfectly with the ""therapist"" role he envisions. There are some artists who complained that Rubin was almost never at the studio, and while I think that Rubin did this intentionally, it also shows that this approach doesn't work for everyone. 

Some bands need a leader, some bands need support, some bands need a mediator, and some need a guidance counselor. Rubin is that last one.",3

If the artist is inherently unable to judge their own work, how are they supposed to judge what ideas are worth spending time exploring? Because so far I am either not making the right choices, or none of my ideas are worth exploring.

They are amazing at unique textures (I don't know a single other act that can 100 percent pull off their synth sounds). And they are also amazing at small, sub-mix details.
