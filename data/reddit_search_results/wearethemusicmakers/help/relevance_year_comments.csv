Like the other commenter said, the market is oversaturated. Even niche genres have more music than anyone could ever possibly listen to and don't need more. So you're not going to get popular based on your music alone. You're going to get popular by making awesome music, *and*  being a familiar face and a cool hang.",241

In my band's case, we started when all of us were also starting university. So we played in every event, small or big, in our universities. Parties, student strikes, festivals, concerts, whatever there were in our faculties, we were there. This exposed us to an inmediate audience, over and over, for years. Then part of that audiences started to follow us to other gigs outside the universitary ones.

Also helped association with other kindred bands, most of which we met in the universitary gigs as well. Playing live with other, similar artists is the foundation to grow a scene. You will expose each other's audiences and they might end being fans of all the bands.

Best of lucks!",44
121s4xw,jdo2g7a,wc_helmets,1679779051.0,"I posted this here recently. Keep in mind I make kinda noisy, experimental droney stuff.

Even with experimental music, it's all about networking. But networking doesn't have to be this cold, transactional thing. In my case, around 2018, after making music mainly for myself for 20 years, I became more active on Twitter and found a family of other musicians, artists, writers, labels, and radio folks who all wanted to be part of something. But beyond finding people to help me promote my work, I found people whose work I myself admired as well. I think the authenticity of relationship is most important. If that's not there and it's all just hashtags, you won't get anywhere. And these relationships will change and ideally grow with time.

Get your music up on Bandcamp, make some codes, and start looking for mixcloud radio shows that fit your music and give those codes out. It's a convenient way to get people to listen and download your work. Get to know those people. They are more than willing to add music into their programs. Find like-minded labels on Bandcamp. Hit them up. Find blog writers. Hit them up too. 

It all takes work, and ideally an office job that doesn't monitor your internet (stay productive, though!!) but it can be done. I don't tour. I wish I did. But doing all this, I've had my music featured in Bandcamp's Best of Experimental and Best of Ambient monthly columns,  Bandcamp's Best of Experimental end of year column for 2022, Tiny Mix Tapes in 2019, and The Quietus in 2021. I've also been placed in Spotify's Fresh Finds: Experimental and Noise editorial playlists, on top of (most importantly) finding my world isn't as insular as I may have thought. 

Good luck, and keep honing your craft.",25
121s4xw,jdpe5nh,highschoolgirlfriend,1679801336.0,"start going to shows and make friends.  this is the most important thing.  be a friendly face and a good hang.  even if your music is great you’re fighting an uphill battle if you’re a dickhead and unpleasant to be around.  

start playing shows.  

make sure you’re playing good shows though.  i dont even just mean performance-wise, i’m talking about good venue, good lineup, good outfits, good days of the week. 

be intentional with how you book shows.  dont feel like you have to say yes to every gig.  when you’re first starting out it may be good to play as many shows as possible, but try to eventually move away from that as you become more of a familiar face in the scene.  make sure you’re playing with good bands that fit the genre of music youre playing in.  make sure theres some kind of thematic/aesthetic consistency across all of the bands, instead of playing shows where they just booked whichever random bands were the first to respond.  you only want to release the best of your best music, and not just throw everything you make at the wall and seeing what lands, so its intuitive (in my opinion at least) to apply the same philosophy to booking shows.  

play shows that are easy to get people excited about, and that you know people will show up to.  generally better to preform on weekends than weekdays.  youll end up playing a whole lot less cringe gigs that way and people will take you more seriously and think of you as someone who is seriously invested in their art instead of someone who is just a hobbyist.  

try to avoid shitposting on your main band social media accounts as well, for again the same reason that people will take you less seriously as an artist.  its okay to definitely be fun and silly on your social media, but try to keep the main focus on your music and presenting yourself as a cool band.  

go to lots of parties.  throw lots of parties.  easier said than done if you’re not an extroverted person but it really is a great way to grow a network.  

when you do play a show, try to think of that whole night as being for the show.  dont show up, play your set, and then immediately leave for drinks with your friends.  its a bit disrespectful to the other bands.  you agreed to show up that night and play music, so the least you can do is set aside the whole night to be there for the other bands who helped make it possible when you can.  admittedly i even struggle with this sometimes, especially when the draw isnt very big, it can be very easy to talk yourself out of staying, but being the band that stays for the whole set is a good way to let other people know that you’re invested in the community success and not just your own success.

take videos of other bands playing and post them.  tag them in them.  

people that go to underground shows (especially people who are new to the scene) are generally there to experience something that will make them feel interesting or niche.  feed into that desire by doing something that fulfills it.  are you a punk adjacent band?  play your set while wearing a plastic garbage can as a costume.    are you a quirky indie band?  hand out tomatoes before the show to give to people to throw at you.  are you a singer/songwriter?  teach the audience your lyrics and ask them to sing a chorus or two along with you.  make them feel like they’re a part of something greater than themselves.

and again most important of all is be kind and considerate to other people.  this isnt high school, its not a popularity contest like some others in the thread have said.  thats a very immature mindset to have in my opinion.  not to say that you have to unconditionally like everyone you meet but just be respectful towards others.  treat other people as human beings with their own lives and interests instead of just little wooden pegs you can grab to “social climb” the scene.  you’re not better than or above anyone else.",11
121s4xw,jdoz086,kjfdkjfdkjfdkjfd,1679793929.0,"Everyone is saying ""play live, be there in person, play live."" This is obsolete advice. Maybe 20 years ago it was cream of the crop, but not now.

I've accumulated multiple songs with >10 million streams and live off a monthly royalties paycheck, and have never once done a live show.

Playing live DOES help and fans like it, but for the last 10 or so years, what helps most is having online relationships with collectives and labels. You want your song in a Spotify playlist, or Apple Music playlist. That's where fans and money come pouring in. Playlist curators look out specifically for music distributed by collectives and labels, and seldom randomly come across independent music. These curators are some of the most powerful people in the music business right now.

You'll have to give the label/collective a 50% cut (typically), but..

I went from making $12/month to $1150/month almost overnight, fanbase blew up very quickly, all because I got 2-3 songs put in a couple playlists, thanks to being distributed by a label.

So yeah, start getting used to not independently releasing if you want to blow your fanbase up. Also, keep the stream of content consistent. Don't lie dormant.",33

I don't have the slightest idea to whom I would even send some codes other than the friends who already hear my music from the first draft until they buy the final master as a show of support. Looking for labels for my music, but that too is a needle in a haystack. In a different comment, I asked about Collectives. Maybe that's a good place to start?

Add people on Facebook that you can find that makes similar music to you. Look at their pages to see who's active on their pages. You'll find other musicians, add them. Eventually find some music managers, A&R guys for small labels, etc. Add them. Add everybody doing music stuff, lol. The Facebook/Instagram biographies typically tell you exactly who they are and their occupation/music alias, so read those. You won't talk to 99% of them from the get-go, but having them within reach *just in case* is game-changing. Comment on their stuff, like their posts, say you're a fan. etc. That's a good start. You'll find that a lot of them have 1000+ facebook friends because they've been doing the same thing, adding everybody, for years

Then, find some collectives/labels that share your sound, and aren't too big. Something appropriate for your size. If you're starting at ground zero, collectives/labels that have like sub-3000 followers. Message them that you're a big fan and are going for a similar sound, share your proudest work. One will eventually bite. See if you can get them on Facebook or IG. You may already have. Get to know them. Be friendly and don't just try and sell yourself. Dudes in the lower-end industry are transactional, but also friends

Eventually, hopefully, one will agree to post your song. Collectives network as well, so one collective posts a song, other collectives listen to that song. Other collectives become interested in you. You start getting messages and friend requests.

And it just kind of snowballs from there. Work your way up, bigger labels and collectives.

I posted with a collective that had about 8k followers, stuck with them for a few months on a single-to-single or EP basis, that got me my first 3-5k followers through their fans give or take, then eventually piqued the interest of bigger labels. An A&R guy for a bigger label heard one of my songs thanks to it being posted to one of those smaller collectives, messaged me on Facebook (didn't even know we were friends, because I add everyone lol), asked if I had anything in the works. Shared my proudest work once again, they released it, it got playlisted, income went up 1000% lol. That's when the snowball gets out of control and you start getting some *real* leverage.

After the 3-4 years of getting competent enough at writing music, this process of networking and going from fanbase ground zero to living off music took about 2-3 years.

Nick drake is a good example, some of the most sublime music ever commited to tape and the general public didn't catch on for decades.

I grew up rather shy and isolated and had low self esteem. Music taught me to move beyond that stuff. Performing and touring and meeting tons of people, you just learn how to be outgoing and charming and you stop worrying so much about what people think. I’m very grateful to have been put in the position to learn these life skills. 

But at the same time, for me, none of this really resulted in getting paid or making a living. OP asks about success in an underground scene, and I think it’s worth considering what kind of “success” you’re hoping for. You can put years of effort into making music and gladhanding in your local scene and this is a great way to develop your music and be influenced by other people that are similarly dedicated to music. What it’s not a great way to do, is make any money, or even make real friends. Music scenes are often very high school imo, and even if you put tons of effort into being in the scene and meeting people, all you really get in the end is a bunch of hipsters know your first name lol. Just be very aware what your goals are and whether or not you’re working toward them in a tangible way because it’s easy to waste a lot of time trying to impress people who will never genuinely give a shit about who you are or your music. A lot of people are there mainly to party and try and climb to the top of douchebag mountain.",5

One way to locate them (and labels/distributors in general) is to look for underground playlists made by Spotify that you think your music would fit well in. Go through the releases on that playlist, and [see who's distributing the songs e.g. this song from ""Fresh Finds"" Playlist.](https://ibb.co/sW0rTXB) Make a list of all those labels/distributors listed that you can find, seek out their email addresses, social media, ways to communicate with them.

by whom? by a company, a magazine, by MTV. in other words, by certain people who happened to have the power to decide what was worth recording from, according to them, what was not.

sure, a good bunch of those people were music aficionados, so they were well informed about music, enough to make them able to identify great stuff amongst the crowd, but another bunch was business people wanting to get/stay rich.

even the music aficionados, it's not like they were machines running algorithms...they were people, and in that crowd there were other great stuff that simply got overlooked. there's just no room for everybody.

talk about common misconceptions. there's this one about how successful sellable music is something from another dimension, an especial ethereal dimension that only those born ""true"" artists or those who spent the first 21 years of their lives playing and practicing 10 hours a day will be able to access, feel and bring their otherworldly inspired music pieces for us civilians to admire. I don't buy that anymore.

 Stairway to Heaven is not from the sky. Paranoid Android either. These are music created by bands we learned to love and admire, but these pieces of music are not special. They are special to us, fans, but not special on its own. If STH had a different solo, we would have loved it anyway. If PA had a fourth section, we would have loved it anyway. The next Deftones album? I'm going to enjoy it anyway. More or less then Saturday Night Writs, doesn't matter. I love their music. I was *informed*, consciously and subconsciously, about how their music is great. Luckily, this rational/pessimistic/cynical view did not remove my ability to enjoy music. I don't think about it when I hit play. 


Back to the point, you don't need to be born special or become special through ""grinding"".  in reality, you, as a musician, just have to do something. anything. preferably, something that's not garbage (but even garbage sells, we all know that). Done that? Now comes the most important part:

you need the right people  to tell your music is good. how? if not born rich and/or a nepo baby, through connections and, of course, luck. lots and lots of luck.",2
