1273qi7,jecekft,BarbersBasement,1680221041.0,The latency inherent in bluetooth transmission makes using headphones nearly impossible.  The best bet is to get an IEM transmitter/receiver that uses RF instead of Bluetooth.,7

1273qi7,jednal1,drh713,1680245655.0,"aiaiai makes some.  Several youtubers are using them in their videos (while making music).  Supposedly a tiny amount of latency, but low enough to use while tracking/producing.

I have an ANCIENT set of gamer headphones by turtle beach.  They have a base station and connect over RF.  I don't have them connected now, but I when I use them, I have the base station connected to one of the outputs on my monitor controller.

The latency is low enough that I can use while recording.  I'm not recommending them (seriously, they're from the ps3 days); but assuming you're just looking for an alternative to be wireless while recording, you may be able to get away with something similar.

When I say ""latency is low enough""; I'm mostly talking about playing midi instruments.  Some people are more sensitive to latency.  Recording vocals with them would drive me insane.",1
1273qi7,jecmroz,walrusmode,1680224717.0,"I got audio Technica m50xbt. They’re studio grade headphones that also happen to have Bluetooth. When I’m using them in the studio, or playing synths, I use the cable. When I’m listening to podcasts and cooking or whatever, I use them as Bluetooth headphones. Pretty happy w this product

The headphone cable is not that long and it is 1/8”, so you’ll probably need an adapter / extender. I was pleased to see that when using the cable the battery is not drained. I’m also super impressed w the battery life of these. It took me two months of almost daily use for a couple hours at least to drain it",1
1273qi7,jeck1t3,BobKillsNinjas,1680223472.0,"I got a cheap Anker Transceiver, it works, but latency makes playing things in live less than desirable.

Look for IR and RF wireless options and ""Wireless TV Headphones"", I have been meaning to, but havent had a chance to dig in deep yet..",1
1273qi7,jecsh1j,dashboardx,1680227338.0,there are adapters for sale that you could use! i’ve seen adapters for audio technicas specifically (my headphones of choice),1
1273qi7,jecf0nu,StreamKaboom,1680221238.0,"Gotcha, thank you. Would their signal be stereo on most models? It's one thing to send a guitar signal to an amp, but another to send a DAW through to headphones.",1
1273qi7,jed8y7e,Mike-ggg,1680235722.0,"And if you're using them to record, then you need to play slightly ahead of the click.

Any noticeable delay can throw you off unless you can get used to it and compensate for it. I don't know how the church pipe organ players can do it. I guess they just play what's written and keep good time and learn to ignore the sound lag or consistently play just ahead of the beat.",1
1273qi7,jedng16,StreamKaboom,1680245781.0,"Ahhh, thanks for the input mate, I appreciate it!! This would mainly be fore recording guitar, but also some vocals, so I'm not sure how well that would work out-- but I'm definitely going to keep doing research. Thanks so much for the suggestions and help!",1
1273qi7,jegu040,rhythmFlute,1680301896.0,"I own a pair of Aiaiai wireless studio headphones, and I absolutely love them. I never realized how tethered to my chair I was producing prior to going wireless, and now it's a dream to move around the studio.

The latency isn't perceptible, so I use it for tracking all the time. The only box they don't check is they have a bit of a high noise floor, so I still use my wired headphones / monitors when I'm mixing.

They aren't cheap, but they are worth every penny.",1
1273qi7,jecfnpx,BarbersBasement,1680221523.0,I don't recall any IEMs that are mono.,2
1273qi7,jef2y10,refotsirk,1680276590.0,"Xvive wireless system you can get off Amazon/sweetwater/etc has okay latency and will work for this - you'll need a 1/4 TRS to xlr adapter to connect to your outputs on the back of the interface. They work as mono input into the device with a regular phones jack out of the phones amp, which I assume is what you want based on above, but I dunno.",1
