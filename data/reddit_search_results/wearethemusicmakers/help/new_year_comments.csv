1264wav,je870sv,FloorModelMusic,1680144509.0,You’ll need a second microphone in order to record either true stereo or dual mono.,2
1264wav,je8aueb,dddDonnie,1680146467.0,"Two microphones, set apart. One for the left channel, the other for the right. Start 10-15” apart from each other and the amp/speaker. Take multiple takes, working the microphones away from each other and the amp. You’ll find a sweet spot, and get your woodshedding in.",1

1264wav,je8yw2x,FloorModelMusic,1680163298.0,"In that case you might consider recording your guitar direct (with a fake amp plugin inserted), then playing that DI track (without the fake amp) out through one amp and micing & recording the result, then playing the same DI track through the other amp and micing & recording it. Any pedals that offer either true stereo options (e.g.  hall of fame reverb) or have modulation you can manipulate ever so slightly (e.g. a real space echo, memory man, phasor, etc) while the track is playing back through the amp will help increase the stereo spread.",1
