A band I've been in for a while but never really promoted before. I've played on a lot of the recorded material and helped to produce a few of the records. Each record is kind of its own trip. The project covers a pretty expansive range of genres; centered around being an indie/psych rock band, but leans heavily towards different/specific influence per release. 
For example, our three most recent records are an experimental indie record, an instrumental motorik record, and an instrumental ambient record.

FFO: indie rock, krautrock, ambient, psych rock, electronic music, folk, lofi, drone

[Sasha Vie - “Signal 18” (Spotify Apple etc)](https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/sashavie/signal-18)

I was aiming for an early 80s inspired vibe, as if this were made in East Germany - electronic music that isn't gloomy but melancholic as if it were perpetually overcast and wet outside but cozy inside

All synths were composed entirely using Logic Pro's stock instrument library (though I used 3rd party plugins to mix it) on a mini Arturia keyboard while I was on vacation with just a laptop

The video was rotoscoped footage of a train ride somewhere in Europe

The idea behind the song is an astronaut blasting off into space, the space craft breaking down, crash landing on an unknown planet, stepping out of the broken ship into the unknown and encountering a cosmic god and a feeling of oneness with the universe. 

I'm not really sure what genre you'd define it as to be quite honest.
