10df5eq,j4l54d4,Florianstep,1673878750.0,"Sadly just a good album won't be enough to get you signed. It's always a combination of things making it appealing to sign you.

If you already have a decent following, a good album might be enough. If you don't have a following yet, you need to start building one and shows are probably the best method for that. And then you can get into how marketable you are, how unique amongst countless other artists and bands. Have you got a band image figured out? Is any member somewhat known already?

Just don't give up. It would be amazing if all that mattered was making good music, but there is so much more to it.

And when you finally get a contract, keep cool heads and read through it carefully before signing anything. It's easy to get screwed over.",54

10df5eq,j4lcji5,King_Penda,1673882065.0,"So, I was inches away from being signed to a major  before it all fell apart. 

Our band started. 

Wrote music as band together. 

Pestered venues for gigs. 

Got gigs, impressed people, who then wanted to see more of us. 

Did more gigs, and toured with more successful bands by impressing then as a support so they asked us to go on tour with them. 

Recorded our first EP

Came to do our first headline show which sold out at about 400 people. 

Got interest from a smaller independent label
They released the EP

Got a booking agent who also booked for big successful bands.

Got a manager who who also managed big successful bands. 

Started touring a lot, had labels come and see us at shows.

Released another EP

Played bigger shows

Started playing festivals in lower spots.

With the mix of playing a lot, having a decent fan base, having a decent social media following, having over 100k plays on our songs on Spotify etc and having a manager who believes in us we were finally approached by a major. 

We were given money to record an album. We did that. The band had issues, 1 member left as the realisation we were going to tour the world for a living set in…. Covid happened…..everything went on pause…. Another member left. Band ended. 

All of the above from starting out to the major approaching us took about 5 years in total and a LOT of graft. 

In that time i have tons and tons of contacts from promoters to managers to venues to labels and majors etc. blank emailing albums hardly every works, and probably about 0.05% get picked up.",42

There's 100,000 other unsigned artists thinking the same thing you are.

10df5eq,j4m7ux2,El_Hadji,1673894008.0,"Most important thing is to sign with a label that really understands the niche/sub-genre you are into. 

My band signed with a label a year ago after having released a few digital singles and an EP. We didn't have a massive fanbase (still don't) but we had made a name for ourselves as being fun to watch live. We were approached by several labels actually, but since we knew what we wanted to get out of the deal, we declined most offers. 

What we wanted was to grow our fanbase, release a professionally mixed and mastered album on vinyl, CD and cassetre in addition to digital releases and to get a chance to play at larger venues. All this without signing away the rights to our music. One label met our requirements and on Friday this week we are having the release party for the album. We are also booked for live shows until July. 

I'd say the reason we got approached by labels was that we already had created some buzz around ourselves. We had a small but very loyal fanbase and the label could see that we probably would sell records and tickets to shows. At the end of the day this IS a business and the label has to get a return on their investment. 

You mention that you are limited by being in your 30's? Cute... We started the band as 50 year olds and released our debut single in April 2020. Age is just a number.",7

If you're not playing shows, touring, or have so much word of mouth buzz that it's already a layup to profitability for them, they don't give a shit about you and never will.

You won't noticed, signed, or see a dime from them. It doesn't even matter if you're awesome. Seriously, that doesn't factor in here.

You're working guys doing some side shit, just be happy with the music you make. You might find an indie label, or a way to get your stuff viral/paying, but even that is a thing of odds so slim it borders on lunacy to consider.

How long have you been a band and how much of a working band are you?  The labels are going to want to see previous grass root fan growth, meaning substantial numbers in streaming without a lot of paid playlist placement,  tour history, hard numbers on ticket sales in local metro areas, and probably representation (a manager).

Labels typically do not take chances on unknown or new artists.  The stories of bands being ""found"" at a dive bar are generally one in a million or a myth.  They want to see that you're working hard before they fork over any money.  Any money that they ""give"" you is a loan and must be paid back.  Labels are great for distribution and exposure avenues, but they want to see that the band/product is marketable by themselves before they invest in it.  

If you feel like you're not at this point, try pushing this album locally and in your closest city and headlining a show, maybe a short tour, and then for your next album show your history will speak for itself.",2

I received mountains of mediocre records from groups I'd never heard of before. If you aren't good enough to gain a following by yourself, get exposure and a fan following through streaming/community radio/local scene and YouTube, you have not proven yourself to be a very bankable commodity. Make them come to you. Mind you, I worked there over a decade ago and my opinion now is major labels are useless in terms of funding and marketing. The only reason to be on a major label now is to take advantage of their legacy connections to things like booking agencies, publishing etc. There's never been a better time to not need record labels, just be the best you can be and people in positions of power will smell the blood in the water",2

2. An inability to tour for whatever reason is pretty much disqualifying (I’m sure not EVERY label, but…)

I would just put out your own music and if the appeal is truly broad your streaming/sales will show it and people will probably start cold emailing you

Same here had a bunch of records released, played shows, a few tours etc. sent tons of press kits, demos media to labels and never got a response. Here is what our mistake was. Only two members were committed to music and trying to make it, we did all the leg work and money spending while the other guys were chilling in their little worlds. It takes a tremendous amount of work to get noticed which included going to other bands shows, meeting new people, making friends. We were just like everyone else with our noses up in the sky, cuz we thought we were the best. 
  Plus nowadays you don’t need labels, all of the music is free. Streaming apps get all the money, once you release your album and register it you are obligated to stream on Spotify. Why would I buy your album if I can listen to it for free? So unless you are ready to sell stadiums labels won’t care about you. Don’t bet your life in music, there is no money there.

If you have the time, you can also try to build your audience online via social media. I don’t have much experience with that, but lots of people do this and later look for a label that will basically take it over and manage it for you. 

Looking for a label with only having an album might be difficult. I guess, it’s risk management for the label. They receive hundreds of submissions every day from bands that put a lot of work and effort into building their fan base.

Your purpose (if you want to get on a label) is to show how your music can make money. Do people like it? How many people show up to your gigs? Can you sell it? Do you run out of merchandise at every gig? Has a venue offered you a residency? How many followers do you have online? How can a label make money off you? All these questions need specific numbers that are great, otherwise why would they want to invest in a product that won’t make money. Don’t confuse your passion with the point of a product when dealing with the music business. If you run into a label that wants to sign you because they “like” your music, run away,, they are new and don’t know how to run a business. If you want to make a living off making music, you need to sign with someone that knows how to make money. Get a manager, don’t get ripped off by paying them upfront. Look, first sell out of merchandise at every gig, that will be your first confirmation that your music is good enough to sell. If not, then don’t get disappointed and keep it as your passion.

It depends a lot on your scene and the label itself though - labels have goals, as you do, and some may be to assess whether something is commercially viable for them, other goals may be around contributing to a scene or releasing music that they are particularly passionate about.  I have had music signed off the back of unsolicited demos, and also had labels who didn't think I was quite there give me useful advice or pointers.

On commercially viable: you note that as the record has already been produced, that \_only\_ leaves PR and marketing - PR and marketing is \_a lot\_ of effort and/or expense, and labels need to make sure that they feel they can make this investment with as little risk as possible.  If PR and marketing is not a big thing and you have the money or bandwidth to do it yourself, it's worth considering whether you actually need a label for this release.",1

Without seeing a promo package, seeing the band live in front of an audience (preferably with a whole lineup of other bands), listening to your demo work and EP, and understanding your current market penetration/fanbase, what advise could anyone really give you that is not just generic puffery?

Look at it from the standpoint of a venture capitalist. Why am I investing in you? They have their own motivations and needs, and outside some intense personal reaction to your work, ""Wow that singer is 1 in a million"" who has the looks, charisma, and presence to connect to an audience, in all likelihood, the decision maker has seen it all, and has a rather jaundiced or skeptical view to your personal enthusiasm for your work. It's really a show me the numbers kind of business unless you are some teenager being signed to a modest developmental deal. Basically, ""Is there already a fire here, and will pouring some gas on it make it explode?""

Bands are extremely tough to get signed in the current environment where most popular music is in the hip hop genre, which is much cheaper to produce, and more lucrative if it gains traction.

He was so amused that he went out that night and gave it a listen. Ending up signing us, and connected us with many labels, agents, and just did a ton of stuff to help us break through. He was an exceptional guy just coming up in that world. 

But yeah, spend your time trying to connect with some sort of representation, as many labels typically don’t accept unsolicited submissions.

The power of a YouTuber helped us rack up like 10,000 in the first 12 hours of releasing our first song. We had offers from Fearless, Roadrunner and a few other smaller labels within a week. Played our first show the following week after that, negotiated and signed a deal with Roadrunner in less than a year after all of that. All from a 5 song EP recorded in a closet and a garage. Anyone can do it. You just have to be smart about it. Connect with others to get your music out there. Don’t rely on a label.

Often people try and run before they can walk. 

Making full albums when you haven’t even played 5 gigs, you can create music all you want and put it online but if you don’t have the fans, no one’s listening.

Our first gig was supporting a touring band, we emailed the venue and showed them a really rough demo we had done on logic, ya know, interface, guitars, plugins, recorded the drums the best we could etc…. as it was in a similar vain to the headline act he gave us a chance. 

From our first gig we sort of blew people away, afterwards we had a lot of people asking us who we were, did we have music out, when we are next playing, even asked if we had merch etc. 

We just told everyone to follow us on Instagram erc…. Music coming soon. 

From that gig word of mouth went around from people saying we were a band to look out for, so we kept repeating the first process, try and support touring bands playing in our city who are successful that way we can play to a lot more people than we could doing our own show and people who already liked us could come and see us play. 

And the the rest happened…….

Gig, gig, gig, gig, gig, record music, Try and get a booking agent / manager.

Start playing live to drum up excitement at the local level, and if you want a further reach, find someone who can run Spotify and YouTube ads. 

I saw you mention playing to tracks while looking for a full time band. That’s what I did, and I highly recommend it. Tracks definitely aren’t as fun as a full band, but if you get a drummer who’s down to play to a click in the in-ears, that will do wonders for your live set and the rest can be tracks.

If you want to tour, you hire a booking agent.  If you want distribution, you can use distrokid or cdbaby.  Labels don’t do all these things for you.
Now if a big indie like barsuk, subpop, or similar offers you a deal, that’s worth exploring if only for the value of the association.  That can help you find better booking agents and publicists.",5

>Me: “hey label who has similar artists to that of us! Look at this shiny finished product we have! You don’t have to do anything other than sign us and advertise our work! We can play shows and open for artists that come through out areas!”
>
>Label: “This sounds great, I think we can make something work and see how it goes. We will put you on as openers for x,y, and z tours coming through your area this year”

You're 1000 times better off getting to know the people at the club who actually do the booking that have touring acts coming through.  90% of those opening slots are usually local bands looking for and getting paid in exposure that the club puts on the bill.

Do really well on one and you ll get another and eventually you might even be offered a paying gig at said club. 

In your scenario where is the label going to make any money having you open 1 or 2 shows a year for the artists that do make them money. 

You're not even to a point where a manager comes into play let alone a label. 

I spent a year backing an Independent artist in Nashville who had an investor pay for an album that had A list session players, great production, good original songs that were very radio friendly. Enough connections with people who could make it happen, etc. 

We played for $50 a person plus tips 5 nights a week on lower Broadway and went nowhere. 

It's easy to be the big fish in a mud puddle but get caught up in a flood and you might find out your a minnow.

Until you get yourself ready for the flood you're as worthless to a label as they are to you.",1

The skills needed to grow an Instagram or tiktok following are completely different from the skills required for recording catchy songs and entertaining crowds. So much so, that it is akin to if we evaluated potential medical students based on their 40 yard dash times.

I understand that following typically translates into better ticket sales, but it seems like, more so now than ever, that the skills required to make it in music all have less to do with music than ever before. Your music cannot carry you, and neither can your performances. To breakout through the algorithm, you must either be super rich or be a skilled video-editor, photo-editor, sketch comedian, and short film director in addition to already needing to be your own musician, songwriter, accountant, contract attorney, touring manager, publicist, producer, sound engineer, lighting engineer, etc.

To make it, it really takes the work of dozens of people, and that costs money most artists will never have. Labels used to scout for talented performers and songwriters and then provide the infrastructure.

edit: if you can show to a label for example, that with x amount of followers you have a conversion rate of x amount of revenue, that’s extremely valuable info for a company to negotiate and consider going forward with you so it’s not just exclusively the amount of followers, more the conversion hype momentum etc..
