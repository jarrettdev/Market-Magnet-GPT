They are hired because of their talent, relationships, and/or because they may sport a particular style or level of attractiveness. For small acts, its the same concept- usually just someone the band knows from either playing gigs or shared recording space or something.

There's no linear path into it and there's plenty of people who have the chops. After that its all about who you know.",10
12brsj7,jeycmki,BarbersBasement,1680634938.0,"Relationships.  Friends hire and refer friends.   Same goes with session work.  

When you are on the road be sure to hang out and meet all of the other acts you end up with on a bill.  

It may also help to join AFM or your local union.",5
12brsj7,jeyc26n,tigojones,1680634713.0,"I want to preface this that what I've written is second hand information I've gathered over the years from musicians I've jammed with and known personally, and various pros that I've been able to briefly talk to, plus some Youtubers who do this and have passed on this kind of information. Basically what I was gathering when I was wondering if this kind of work was a feasible option for me. 

> I’ve always had a dream to be on tour with a large band, and I truly believe I have the skills necessary for that. 

Prove it. That's the long and short of it. Nobody gets into these big acts with no prior experience. Every member of these touring bands has put in hundreds, if not thousands, of hours on stage with smaller acts, they have put the time in doing studio/session work. 

And it's not just about being able to perform on stage or pick up the material quickly, it's about how well you can get along with the rest of the band when you're traveling from show to show all shoved into a bus or van for hours upon hours. If you don't get along well enough, they'll replace you with someone who does, even if you're technically a better player. More than one musician I've talked to has considered this to be the most important part. 

All of this applies with or without an agent, though I would think it a good idea to have one. Many of your opportunities are going to come via people you've played with who think you're a good fit, or from people who've played with people you've played with. Could be that some of your initial contacts and gigs will be through an agent, with some of their other clients. 


Here's the final thing, there are no guarantees, and there will be a lot of competition, so you might never get to the level you're hoping to. Of course, the only way there is to try, so, good luck.",6

12brsj7,jf0myeo,Giganumpty,1680672447.0,"you need to build your name, more or less. your own words and PR has no significance at all, but if you have a back catalogue of ESTABLISHED covers they can find - and your name in the scene is connected to a strong work ethic, that carries a lot of weight. all of that does.

however, please do understand that you do not join them. its not your decision - you really do not have a say on that. they find YOU. yes, it is a thing of luck more or less.

12brsj7,jeyojzo,Known_Ad871,1680639518.0,"I have a friend in a very famous international act, but as a touring member. Basically he was just in the scene in their area and played in a much less successful but much better band and they recognized he was a very skilled musician (and multi instrumentalist). Now he makes decent money and gets to open for u2 and shit, but is stuck playing some of the most bunk ass music I’ve ever heard. Seems like a decent trade off. He’s still not rich though",1
