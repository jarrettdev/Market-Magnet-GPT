Featuring seven different approaches to experimental pop, this release contains seven pieces recorded in the second half of 2019. Many were developed as musical responses to creative challenges within an online collective we participated in. There were experiments involving only percussion, zero percussion, and a collaboration with a modular synthesist. The remaining tracks were experiments in technology, test runs for new methodology, and pieces which didn’t appear to be appropriate for our album The Gamut of Their Philosophy. The album is ripe for rediscovery, and we hope you will assist us during Bandcamp Friday so we may continue to explore sonic possibilities into and beyond the present day.",1

Pricing depends on the project, but illustrations start around $200 per. I am flexible on the pricing depending on the scope of the project and what you may or may not need.

The album is called “Vintage Fidelity”, inspired by Hypnagogic Pop, Lo-Fi, and Outsider music, and especially inspired by artists like Daniel Johnston and Beat Happening. Making music for the sake of expression was what I wanted to achieve, even if the overall mixing is considered objectively bad. I hope someone enjoys it :)

z5veln,iy63f1l,o7i3,1669682816.0,"Excellent, thank you.  I only gave you 15 seconds or so as I’m short on time, but you’ve been added and I’ll revisit.",1
z5veln,iypyefb,poppyjaguar,1670047865.0,Really good vibes on this track. Love how that first chorus kicks in 🙌🏽 Production sounds really good as well. I’ll go follow your Spotify 🤙🏽 It gives me a social distortion/the fray/ELO/Green Day vibe really dig it 🙌🏽,1
z5veln,iya6rqy,vvonce,1669759403.0,"I know this is a music subreddit, the song is good, but I like the video a lot!",1
z5veln,iyg3nuk,CreatureOfTheState,1669864483.0,"I dig the chopped up sounding guitar and the rambling, breathing-right-into-the-microphone vocals. But to me this feels like it either needs to be shorter by like two minutes or needs to have more of a verse and chorus structure to it, headed towards some climax. Don’t really hear that right now.",1
z5veln,iy96tyj,,1669745594.0,Nice sound the vocals are really good too. Great voice,1
z5veln,iy60tdm,o7i3,1669681617.0,I enjoyed it.  That part around 1:50 had me melted.,1

z5veln,iy96nhu,,1669745526.0,Nice guitar it’s a little too much in the background you should bring it to the front more,1
z5veln,iy0mntd,bobbyduane,1669583543.0,"I agree, and the Artist that do give their views are bias towards their own style and likely more critical, even if they like it.",1

z5veln,iyrv3mr,Middlebees,1670090369.0,Thanks!! I really dig your take on this tune and I'm so glad you enjoy it!,1
z5veln,iyq991b,saungsmyth,1670056636.0,"Right on, thanks for the input. I wrote this one with my soul being crushed and it's exactly how I felt. The emotions are real, the metaphors of my loss, and the structure is not typical because it's a walking rumination, not a sentiment, picture, nor a story. Listen to it imagining the singer walking through the city taunted by wildflowers but no one to pick them for and questioning why he ever did. And vowing not to ever again.There's no climax in this song, it's rumination on loss and grief. Thanks for listening",1
z5veln,iybu4dt,MindFellow,1669787554.0,Thank you so much i appreciate the listen and kind comments.,1

z5veln,j0h4jms,Em29111,1671208343.0,"Thanks for listening! Should've said it's an album, my bad.
I think we tried to explore sounds outside usual trap production, mostly in the guitars and synths. There's also something very unique about his lyrics, but being in spanish can make that hard to see.
However I guess it can sound kinda pretentious the statement of it being deviant, not what i tried to convey xD
Thanks for the feedback anyway
