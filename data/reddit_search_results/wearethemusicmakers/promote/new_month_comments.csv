11ku4hq,jbcniua,WhereTFAmI,1678241262.0,"[Hard Rock/Metal] Looking for a drummer with a real drum kit who can write a beat to my song. I’ve made a MIDI beat (which sounds decent), but I’d prefer the sound of a real kit. 

Take a listen, and tell me what you think. It’s a quick mix, so I’d recommend listening on headphones or good quality speakers. It’s just instrumental right now. Vocals coming soon. 

DM if interested! Thanks!

I suggest turning it up. Music is good to hear, but it’s great to feel! ;)
