I hope you find what you are looking for. It should be easier than ever to connect with people but I’m also kind of at a loss of how to do that in real life. I spent almost 20 years playing at churches because that’s the easiest place to grow as a musician and regularly play with people. Even if the music wasn’t very challenging or interesting it was still a rush to be part of a tight and precise band, and have the structure of specific songs to learn and perfect. I’ve kind of walked away from that scene and want to see if I can find another creative outlet with music. I think my first step will be to get setup with a basic recording interface and start messing around with that. Then maybe I can at least trade tracks with people virtually. But yeah, I also need to connect with humans face to face and jam stuff out. Not sure how to find people aside from texting people I’ve played with to see if they know of a situation I can jump into. 

Best of luck to you in your search.",2

I'll record guitar and bass parts at home and slap some midi drums, synths and effects on it and send it out to a buddy of mine back in California to write lyrics and track vocals. I grew up in LA and there was a much more booming scene and it was a lot easier to get a project going but it's a bit more difficult out here where there doesn't seem to be as much interest in this type of music. Best of luck to you too man.",1
