When I want to Collaborate with others, I usually head to Kompoz (Compose) .com - Musicians from 'Around The World' are on there.  This is a Great Opportunity to work with Musicians that are into other Styles of Music, that you don't normally do as well!  Give it a Try.  --- Here's a link to the Collaboration Song Ideas area.

100pyi0,j2jocy0,shep_pat,1672606824.0,"I’m a jazz musician who has the same problem. I have a little studio, I love playing with ableton and making cool little tracks. Can not find people in nyc to work with. They are all pros or they left long ago etc.",16
100pyi0,j2k9ch2,bedroom_fascist,1672615437.0,"Very similar situation - had a 'run' in the 80's/90's and just want to create, not make it big.  Anyhow, long response, hope some of it is helpful.

- Once talked about this with a longtime musician friend.  Bitched about not finding people on CL (LOL now at myself).  He said ""it's like a long, slow fishing trip.  Eventually you *might* catch one, but you want something else to do meanwhile.""   Actually really helped with my mindset.

- You are probably aware of what you are seeking.  Be able to communicate clearly, right up front (e.g., ""for less than $1,000 I'll NEVER play out on a weeknight"" or ""if I dedicate what would otherwise be family time on a weekend, and you flake, I will find it hard to feel good about making plans again"").  No need to be unpleasant, but clear always helps.

- Put stems or other ""projects seeking someone else"" / incomplete mixes online.  That way, should you run into a potential collaborator, you can just say ""so, for example, I'm looking for someone to do some drumming for these two songs"" or ""I really need to find someone who can lay this bassline down much better than I can, or maybe write a better one.""  

- Be super-flexible about who / when / how often / etc.  I have had both success and (sadly, recently) failure on collaborations.  The successes usually come from a moment of musical kismet (""I love that riff!  I want to write around it"") that then gets fleshed out / follows its trajectory.  The few times I've had the ""we'll get together every Tuesday at 7:30"" it just didn't work.  YMMV.  TLDR: it has to be about the music, not 'the desire to do something,' though that might seem counterintuitive.

- Try to be open to finding people in different ways.  I have a potential upcoming collaborator whom I could not have stumbled upon in a more-random way: he was a former student of mine in a HS, and I gave him a practice amp at a steep discount.  Lo and behold, I see him post his 'new release' on FB, and fuck me if I didn't follow it to Spotify and find it really compelling (I like weird stuff, so that was a huge surprise).  

- Be sanguine.  I had a collab I was super-confident about last summer.  We both had serious health issues, and are both at the stage where we know how to start, work on and finish a project (him: former major label artist, me: former major label worker / indie artist).  But even though we are musically very simpatico, he ... just couldn't stop smoking cigarettes, making more rounds of coffee, and talking about gear instead of *sitting the fuck down and finishing takes of songs we both knew were already written and waiting.*  His idea of having fun was two hours of socializing and 30 minutes of music and I just couldn't.  Rather than blow up the friendship, I just gave up on the collab.  Which sucks, because there's some solid, solid shit that really deserves to be done.  But for whatever reason, that's not going to happen with him.  Oh well.

- Every now and then just flat out force yourself to do shit you don't like.  Deliberately forcing yourself to seek new connections .... can work.  The universe is random, but sometimes it helps to roll the dice a little more often.

100pyi0,j2j9j3h,ThingCalledLight,1672601114.0,"One tip of advice when you get a collaborator is to treat them with respect. 

Pretty basic advice, but I went in on a project with an artist for over a year. She was super honest about what she liked, what she didn’t, etc. We were making good shit. Then she ghosts me. No warning. So I was still working on stuff for a while before I realized she wasn’t ever going to contact me again. 

If she had said, “I’m not really feeling this project anymore,” I’d have been upset, but at least respected. 

All this work we both did for fucking nothing.

If you've been making music for a long time, I'm sure you've got some release quality tracks. If you can convince a small indie label to put one or two of them out, you'll have access to all the other artists who are releasing on that label. In many cases, the label will actually be keen to put out collaborative tracks as it will double the generally relatively small pulling power of each artist.

Not talking about sending demos to Universal and Sony here, but just look around for local/small/dad labels that put out the sort of music you do, and get in contact with them.

If you don't have any tracks that are fully cooked and ready to go to showcase your style, make that a goal! You'll be much more appealing to prospective collaborators (and those of a good standard) if you're putting your music out into the world. Working with good collaborators is a pleasure, which will make it all the more enjoyable if you're only doing it part time and not generating an income from it.",2

100pyi0,j2l8ehj,imagination_machine,1672631179.0,"Big nope, or be extremely careful. If it were 30 years ago, I'd say go for it. But these days most producers, who have one foot in the game, are hardcore egomaniac, selfish, backstabbing fuckers (Got the T-shirt). 

The reason? Publishing sync deals. And zero money from streaming and the need for a big social following (Not got one? Forget it). Back in the day, if you worked with someone else you didn't know, and the track did well, you'd get recognition and the attention of labels. Because the track would be on the radio, or get widespread play by club DJs. 

But these days, the money is made in sync deals and only streaming if you're a label. And stealing to make big bucks is off the scale, 

Ed Sheeran, and many others, simply steal, then ask persmission (Nothing new, Massive Attack, Coldcut/Ninja Tune, Daft Punk, The Avalanches + many more did it). 

Sheeran has two people in his ""writing team"" whose job (Partly) is to search through thousands of small artists online on Bandcamp and Soundcloud for hooks, lyrics, and melodies to steal. They share royalties (Mostly, in many cases they interpolate instead), but you'd be amazed how many other big artists are doing these days. In fact, this has been common for decades. 

The whole scene is rigged against real artists. Only the massive talents get through these days. The rest are 'business artists', know people in the industry already, or are wealthy (This is more common than you'd realise) and can buy great ghost-writing.

All this BS means that you cannot assume the person you're collaborating with holds the same values as you, and not one of the above. 

Btw, I found out a while back that James Blake's track A Limit To Your Love (Which blew him up), it was a fairly recent Feist cover at the time. It's the identical piano riff, lyrics and melody. That was Blake's collaborator. 

What do we learn from this rant? Your collaborator is a band or someone who has already made a track and published it. Find those tracks, use them in your productions. If you get success with it - see if they like your version and will do a deal with you.

100pyi0,j2leckx,K-Frederic,1672634158.0,"As an amateur producer, I have the same problem as you. Some of my friends asked to collaborate but most of the time they usually just wanna use my skills for their industry success. I'm ok if I can get new experience as long as I can make a new song. Although those people don't have any plans, ideas and visions. Just lean on me and I got stressed out with their attitude. Some of them are nice people but they have some changes in their personal life and don't have enough time for music production and ghosted me at the end.

(I talked about it on my post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/musicproduction/comments/zxvj8z/do\_you\_have\_similar\_experience\_as\_me/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/musicproduction/comments/zxvj8z/do_you_have_similar_experience_as_me/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) )

Just in my experience and a lot of people would disagree with me though, the most enthusiastic musicians that I feel so easy to work with and enjoyed the collaboration for me are the people who met on outsourcing service like Sound Better. You have to pay for hiring them for sure but they are so professional and so easy to work with. Giving me many ideas, quick response, accepting all my requests and always try to make a good song together. Their production quality is awesome of course (depends on the person and the cost you paid them though). It means I collaborated with them as work so didn't have personal connection. Although when it comes to collaborate with a nice and enthusiastic musician, you can think about outsourcing as a choice. This experience inspired me so much.

I'm not sure if anyone here is aware of or ever tried Bandlab.  It's like Facebook/Instagram meets Soundcloud where you can post on a timeline, share music, collaborate on projects, and even work within an online daw for collaborations.  I'm not as big into the front end, but it has useful features that could be useful in a collaborative environment (sharing files, bring in multiple musicians, etc)...I just haven't personally connected with anyone on there.  I use it mainly to archive songs I've done over the years for now.  Just do a search for Bandlab and go from there.

Currently, most of the ""collaborations"" I do are random improvs on a plugin called Jamtaba.  It works over Ninjam servers (anyone who's familiar with Reaper might know what I'm talking about) in near-real time.  I've gotten some pretty nice results on there.  You open the plugin or standalone and you'll see ""room"" where users are jamming with each other.  You can listen in sometimes or just join a room and go from there.  It can be set up to record your sessions also for editing in your daw.  It actually come out sounding very good imo.  In this sense you could get a couple people in a room together and throw ideas out there to see what happens.  Usually, you'll end up with something useable so you can pick through everything in your daw and make something cool and it's unique because it's all taken from an improvisation with random people from around the world.

Their dad was a musician too.  I went to church with a bunch of country stars.  My next door neighbor played upright bass with the Oak Ridge Boys and Bill Monroe for decades.  He’d always tell me stories about how he would play a session, then go sleep in his car until somebody would come out and knock on the window, asking him to play on another record.  My other next door neighbor wrote “Monster Mash”, lol.
It was just everywhere - my sister wanted to be a singer, she cut a demo, wrote a ton of songs, got some fuzzy glamor shots done, and then had all her songs ripped off by a contemporary Christian producer who, almost word for word, replaced “baby” with “Jesus”.  
My dad was gone a LOT, and I watched him really grapple with trying to be available to play gigs, have a job to take care of us, and maintain some kind of artistic integrity.  He did an ok job at all those things, but he really had to prioritize us and my mom at the expense of that career.  We were around a whole lot of scuzzy musicians, at varying degrees of burn out.  Overall, I would say that what I saw was an industry that chewed up young, eager talent, and spit out burnt out people who felt like failures because a one in a million thing didn’t happen to them.

Most indie labels sold their souls to corporations, and are basically part of the advertising industry. The mid-level, so called, indie labels are now run by people you'd expect on trading floors of the stock exchange in the 80s. 

Why? It's less about knowing good music and nurturing talent, and only about counting numbers on streaming services, social media whilst scrolling through popular playlists. If an act you aren't already on one of these radars, forget it. Anyway, A&R will be replaced by AI in ten years. Pluggers and publishers too. Need music for an ad, TV show or film? Just type in a load of keywords, and the AI will give you a load of options, and maybe even make the music for you (Chat GPT v4?).  

Live music is still relatively viable for budding professional musicians, if one can hack the endless touring and can afford to live like a scrub. That was how it was in the 60s-80s, you toured to build a following. Then CDs made the industry stupidly wealthy and artists toured to promote their albums. Now you play gigs if your music does well on streaming. It's reversed! The old-fashioned way is still possible, but so much harder. 

Thank God there are loads of people still making music for fun and putting it out there for the love of music. Scenes like electronic music where it's super cheap for artists to produce thanks to computer power and low price. Amazing music keeps getting released by hobbie artists and labels. No chance of making any money, but they produce it anyway whilst working a day job, I guess. Same thing for folk indie rock in the USA.",2
100pyi0,j33wxtp,imagination_machine,1672955156.0,"Did you read the whole rant? It's not about exposing James Blake as doing anything bad. It's the precise opposite. The point is, collaborations can be very hard when you're starting out because of how rigged the music industry is, and there is a better way, IMHO. When you've made it, collabs great sources of income. Unless you are in a community of musicians and producers that can be trusted 100% to contribute something great, it's too risky these days given the same time and effort could be doing what Blake did. 

So, one of the best ways to ""collab"", is doing a great cover, and like Blake - don't feel you have to go back to the 60s or 70s, or cover a classic. Or, if youre ruthless, you can 'steal' riffs, acapellas (Using AI software to extract vocals), and lyrics from other bands and artists (Daft Punk did this, then collabed later). 

Essentially, do either a cover or remake rather than trying to work with a stranger or someone you might know - because there are better ways to creating interesting tracks and songs when you're starting out. You just have to hope the artist you take from won't ask for all the royalties. Many do, but usually they only do if the track blows up, inwhich case you'll then get asked to do collabs with established artists with a manager where you do a professional contract. 

It worked for Blake. Limit to Your Love helped make James Blake famous as it was the most radio friendly track on his debut album. Now it has 80 million plays, except TWS, all the other tracks don't break 10 million.

She had demos that consisted of vocals only or vocals and uke.

She and I never met in person—only talked in email or Discord. 

We had worked before on one or two songs during February Album Writing Month. I told her I liked her voice and demos. I offered to fully produce the tracks in my studio—all instrument parts—do some rearrangement, possibly modify a lyric or two, and write the chords on ones with only vocals. We’d make an album. We’d go 50/50 as songwriters on them. 

You’re right that I own everything I’ve made, but the melodies (mostly) and lyrics are hers. So I’d basically have to rewrite the songs with new lyrics and melodies. And once you have the original song in your head for so long, it’s tricky to compose all new lyrics and melodies for it, especially without risk of stepping over the line into what her song was. It’s likely just better to create all new shit.",10

Bitter janitors. The fact is, there’s a ton of great, unrecognized talent out there.  Being talented is not enough.  Desire to perform is not good enough.

100pyi0,j2nb1ft,orb_king,1672677504.0,"Ok since this was...perplexingly...moderated away as ""low effort"", I'll put it here in a comment: 

* I don't claim that any of this is my idea, I stole a lot of it from old heads like Pat Pattison and Stephen Webber. Both of them are awesome and you should look them up.  
**The Problem:**  
I found myself stuck in a rut. My ""influences"" were just all over the place, as were my interests. Like most people, I'd listen to trance one day, country the next, and thrash the day after that. Nothing I was making as a musician felt like ""authentic"" self-expression, and my identity wasn't showing through the music in the way I hoped. In hindsight, it seems silly that I believed that my work as a musician would EVER reach that standard, but there I was. I took time off music - months turned into years, piles and piles and piles of drafts, and no releases. None of it gelled together, none of it formed a coherent ""whole"". It was all just doodles and experiments. Expressing my complete identity as a musician was just not working for me, it was absolutely overloading music making for me. Perhaps you can relate!  
**What I Did:**  
I started a new pseudonym for myself, and I sat down with my iPad to plan it out. I used an app called Concepts - pretty much an infinite whiteboard that you can drop images into. I decided that this new project would be themed around some core ideas, I needed a core tension that I could play off of. For me, that tension was going to be ""self-obsession, mental health, new agey movements vs environmentalism"". This satisfies a big need as a musician: VISION!  
I collected a categorized a TON of ideas as images - in my case broadly into ""light"" or ""dark"" elements I'd use in my music. I wrote down a list of themes and ideas. Movies, stories, drugs, sounds, albums, etc.  
I linked these ideas to instruments and timbres. This was deliberately reduced to a handful of instruments and samples. I also defined a mixing style I would use, also explicitly defining what I would not use.  
I defined a process for making a new song/album/etc. In my case this was quite simple: I would sit down and listen to entire, insufferable new age cassettes. I would then extract some samples that carried the new age vibe well. Similarly, I would build a pool of presets that fit this style guide.  
I wrote a huge list of song titles and words that might work with the vision.  
All this was done in one huge, sprawling, fever dream of a whiteboard/document that I come back to often.  
**How this has changed my behavior:**  
When I encounter new sounds and ideas, I consider whether I want to update my style guide, or just deviate from it. Sometimes I have to remove one in order to add one, depending on the context.  
When I plan a release, I take a look at the completed works and try and ensure that they gel together as a whole and they gel with my style guide.  
Naming things is easy.  
I am not burdened by the need to ""express my identity"", it's coming naturally because I am not focused on it.  
Creating songs is 100% easier, because at each step I use the simple dialectic: does this move me closer to the style guide, or farther away?  
When I sit down and make a thing that doesn't fit with my central project, that's ok, I just file it away and consider whether or not I have enough music like it to start another project, or if I see a pattern emerging that might warrant an additional moniker and style guide.",9

\- how long did you spend cultivating this vision before you felt that you had defined enough to move forward into creation?

\- you mention that you would revise and refactor as you encountered more inspirational material. did this include reinforcement of the existing ideas with new inspiration as well?

\- was your intent here to cultivate a long-term creative identity/vision? or did you go into this knowing you would treat them as ephemeral/disposable in some regard?

100pyi0,j2obai0,orb_king,1672691486.0,"So in my case, the song actually came first.  I was practicing the idea of ""not fighting it"" and writing the simplest things I could.  Then I made one that I really liked, and I thought... ""what's good about this, and how do I carry this vibe forward?""

So I sat down and started work on this style guide.  Then I'd work on music, then come back to the style guide and tune it up, etc.  It took a few months before it really got ""settled"" to a place where it became primarily a reference, and edits slowed way down.  Now I consult it when I am stuck.

I had no intentions of creating anything ""long term"", I will work on it until I feel like I've exhausted the angle, and said what I needed to say.  So far I am \~20 songs deep, and feel like I could do another 10-20.

As for Pattison and Webber, I drew from both of them in a very GENERAL sense.  Webber teaches at Berklee, and his lessons on building an artist identity were very useful.  I can't link youtube or I get automodded, but if you look for ""3 Ways to Differentiate Yourself: Artist Identity, Vision, and Intention | Music Business"" ...it's a good place to start.  

Pattison is a little more complex, because I've read his books and watched his lessons and that kinda stuff.  The thing that's most important to learn from him is that songs don't fall out of the clouds into your lap...you can, and should, cultivate your ability to write them.  He has a TON of stuff on YT and tbh I recommend you start anywhere and see if you like the guy.  He's very consistent.",2
