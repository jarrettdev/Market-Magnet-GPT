126g55r,jeegxfu,10000Pigeons,1680267270.0,"The absolute cheapest way to do this is with a TRS -> TRRS cable from the headphone out of the keyboard into a TRRS/Lightning adapter for your iOS device (headphone adapter)

This essentially tricks your phone into thinking you have a headphone/mic combo plugged in.

The mid range option is to get an iRig or something similar, search for ""iOS Audio Interface"".

The best stuff you can get are full audio interfaces that also have lightning output",2
