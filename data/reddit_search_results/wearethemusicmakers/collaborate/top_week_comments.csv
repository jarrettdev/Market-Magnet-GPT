1) Perform at *every* open mic night in L.A. as often as you can. This a free and often fun way to network and find opportunities.

> I can‚Äôt afford to hire professional producers or songwriters

2) These people are *constantly* in need of singers to record on demos or new tracks. If you can write topline even better. Let them hire you.


> do I need to have professionally produced tracks ready to showcase

3) Yes.



> would a management company pay for...

4) This is the most important thing to understand.  Managers take a percentage of your income. **They will not sign you until you prove you can make them money by making music.** They only care about talent and looks as far as it can generate revenue, these things have zero value on their own. Managers will not pay for shit for you, they TAKE money from you when you make it.  So do everything you can to develop a fanbase and start making money NOW.

128ga7b,jeiwtal,Successful_Summer528,1680348385.0,"Put yourself in the shoes of a manager for a record label who wants to find the next ""big thing"". If someone knocked on your door and said ""I don't produce or write any music, I don't have any examples of past work or anything but let me sing a cover for you right now"" do you honestly think if you were a record label that you would take this seriously? To be brutally honest I would slam the door and get back to my busy day.

My point is you shouldn't be worrying about that at this point. Fall in love with creating music first. Write some songs.

Or go on X factor",12

Well, you can either keep trying or you can give up. Working with other musicians is a skill (more like a set of skills) and not developing it will close a lot of doors.

> I can‚Äôt afford to hire professional producers or songwriters

You have three choices. You can collaborate and potentially get these services for free from other musicians in exchange for contributing to their own goals (and putting up with their bullshit). You can learn to do these things yourself (highly recommended either way). Or you can save up and pay someone to do it. 

That old chestnut ""it takes money to make money"" applies to breaking into the music industry big time. If you want to get there without spending money hand over fist then you're basically just going to have to learn to do a bunch of things yourself at a close-to-professional level, and it will still cost a lot even then.",4
128ga7b,jeji0ng,Gloomy_Technology319,1680359988.0,"I listened  to your music. 
Quite a lot of covers.
You don‚Äôt need a producer or a songwriter. 
You don‚Äôt need a manager or an agent. 
Write your own original music. Please do this. 
There‚Äôs no sense in putting out albums and albums of covers without using any of that knowledge to write your own songs. 

Focus on mic technique and not over annunciating. 
Focus on precise rhythm, perfect tonality and phrasing. 

Honing those aspects of your art and also accepting the fact that maybe covering bohemian rhapsody, Jolene, etc with YouTube backing tracks isn‚Äôt necessarily the most based way to invest in yourself or long term success will definitely be a good change.",4

If you can prove to the professional music world that people are digging your stuff and you are making waves, then the pros will want to work with you.
