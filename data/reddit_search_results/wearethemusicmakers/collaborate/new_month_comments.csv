[Sasha Vie - “Go” (Spotify Apple etc)](https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/sashavie/go-itte-)

This Latin-inspired burlesque track was a fun one to put together! 

What sounds like an organ vamp is actually an Eastman AR403 archtop guitar, which seems to have this warm, bloomy vibe unlike any guitar I've ever played, which I recorded straight through a Fender Twin (with only a Wampler Tumnus pedal - a Klon clone - just to give it a boost)

The bass on this one was an Ibanez Mikro (which I've since sold for a Fender Jazz) into a Fender Rumble amp

The drum and horn section were composed using the stock library in Logic on my MIDI keyboard, using the jog wheels to simulate the sound and feel of a human playing a trumpet

For the video, I rotoscoped footage from the 1928 film ""Toasts of Texas

11p8zlb,jdqgnne,OperAI,1679831126.0,"We used AI for composing the chord progression, the drums, the melody and the arrangement. As you mentioned, we curate/pick the sounds by selecting virtual instruments (the AI we use outputs MIDI files in addition to an mp3 file with bad sounds) and also mix/master the final result. We also try to pioneer AI techniques for music making like having chatGTP write patches for Max MSP.  
What comes out straight of the AI sounds pretty bad and interestingly sometimes when trying out some virtual instruments that are very different from the 'bad sounding' mp3, you can get unexpected outcomes.

Totally agree with you, AI still has a long way but I think as music makers we should start using this technology to power up our creativity. At the moment it's not at all like you press a button and you have a hit song ready for radio. I personally hope we won't get there but rather that we will go in a direction in which AI empowers music makers with novel and faster processes and workflows. We will have to go through a change of perspective in any case.",1
