Maybe with a tiny bit of reverb to give it more room to separate it from the main vocal. It's possible the pitch/formant weren't even touched and he just performed it with a higher voice. Probably the more of the low end is cut off than the main vocal so it doesn't clash.


I can say for sure he is using auto-tune on his vocals though.",2
