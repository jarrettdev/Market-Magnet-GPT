12c4onn,jf00zwz,DiyMusicBiz,1680660443.0,Welcome to the world of layering.,44
12c4onn,jf04uu8,kuleemusic,1680662224.0,Now experiment with panning the different layers.,14
12c4onn,jf0mage,Sativa_Dreams,1680671983.0,"never use duplicated vocals. it causes phasing. its okay to duplicate just as a test before you waste time recording, but even with dithering, distortion, offsetting etc. itll still cause phasing. you really have to mangle it to have it not phase",28
12c4onn,jf0904v,Finesteinburg,1680664239.0,I’ve gotten big into layering the past year. It does great things for my soul,5
12c4onn,jf0egji,bynobodyspecial,1680667091.0,"Best process is to have a singular layer for main content, layers for adlibs and hooks.

With that being said, vocal could be comped from multiple layers to sound clearer. Say you recorded the same line 3 times and you really liked one word  on one take and another on the third. Just cut the individual words out and combine them into the original take.",6
12c4onn,jf2365u,koennagel,1680706290.0,"Doing multiple takes and panning them is so time consuming, but the way the end result sounds always ends up being worth it",5
12c4onn,jf05jlg,camseyb,1680662549.0,"I’ll never duplicate tbh. I’ll have one main take, with two extra takes one panned 30-50% right and one 30-50% left. I use these extra takes as doubles to either 
A) vary tone 
B) create complex layered hooks 
C) create emphasis on the end of each of my rhymes, ie the doubles are muted until the very last word or so of each bar",8
12c4onn,jf2ius9,OkAdministration9151,1680712387.0,"It gets done a lot, I used to copy mine and pan each one left and right with different fx, until I realised, subtle layering, emphasising different phrases on each layer, you don’t have to worry about emulating the main vocal if it’s fire and  you can recreate it, just phatten it up with layers.",3
12c4onn,jf3efia,SaltBeatz,1680724230.0,"Oddly enough I'm personally not a fan of ""layering"".  I like the dub/adlib thing but every time a rapper goes over the entire thing, I either mix it to where it's barely audible or just mute it.  
I'm a ""main take"" with a doubler if needed type of guy.",2
12c4onn,jf1cvjd,Wyntier,1680693540.0,I personally hate when the rhyming word is layered. So annoying,-2
12c4onn,jf3stm0,ChrysMYO,1680729682.0,"Layering has its place, especially if your delivery has a more melodic tone to it. 

I used to layer all my verses. But I realized that the more personal, or monologue type verses sound more human or candid when its just one take. I'll still layer ad libs or melodic parts. 

An example of the more personable delivery might be Andre 3K or Drake. Not necessarily when they are super lyrical. There are deliveries where they are trying to talk to the audience 

Versese where I layer verses are more like Tupac or Future, where the tone is more a melody or a vibe than a convo with the listener.",0
12c4onn,jf04e3t,JustburnerOG,1680662002.0,Thank you 🙏🏽I used to layer when I started and noticed how even tho my music was not good starting out that layering really can make a song stand out. it’s definitely beneficial,15
12c4onn,jf09fsu,JustburnerOG,1680664455.0,I definitely start on that panning is another thing as well I just now learning since recording 2019,4
12c4onn,jf0p6ly,TheOriginalLilRapper,1680674063.0,just wanted to add how this is super important... and good example is tupac... and dave chappelle made a funny skit about tupac but you can get a feel for how tupac actually set up the layering without the polishing,14
12c4onn,jf0rv4d,BlackStarArtist,1680676151.0,"New to the whole production side, what is phasing?",2
12c4onn,jf2aloh,mixmasterADD,1680709198.0,"I think there’s a difference between copying one take and layering it, and having multiple takes of the same part layered over each other.",2
12c4onn,jf3z27z,HelpfulVariation4822,1680732250.0,Do you keep them all usually around the same volume level or are the takes that you pan left and right quieter than the main track?,0
12c4onn,jf4nlvr,crrtis,1680743267.0,"Wouldn’t you want the layered take to be barely audible? That way it’s adding a little punch without doing too much but just enough? I only ask because that’s the route I usually go with my stuff, just barely blending them in.

Edit: added shit.",1

12c4onn,jf3z9oq,HelpfulVariation4822,1680732341.0,This is a good take. So many of Andre’s verses would not sound as good if they were layered,1
12c4onn,jf08d4p,DiyMusicBiz,1680663929.0,Character and textures are everything 👍🏽👌🏽👊🏽,6
12c4onn,jf1yqxs,Desperate-Citron-881,1680704503.0,"The simplest form of it is when you have two sine waves that aren’t aligned together, so it makes a “beating” effect that can be slightly unpleasant when unintentional. 

Every sound that isn’t a sine wave is a collection of harmonics that are essentially thousands of sine waves collected at different frequencies. When you layer two things together, but certain harmonics are out of phase, those harmonics are cancelled out, resulting in parts of the sound being lost.",7
12c4onn,jf43o3h,koennagel,1680734246.0,"I make the panned takes a little quieter, but not to the point that the mid vocal is the main focus. If you want, I can send you one of my tracks as an example.",1
12c4onn,jf4938a,ChaotixEDM,1680736676.0,Jokes on you for thinking my overlays would be perfectly aligned lol,3
12c4onn,jf2v2o1,Sativa_Dreams,1680716990.0,slightly unpleasant is putting it lightly lol. phasing is one of the most god awful things you can do in music,-1
