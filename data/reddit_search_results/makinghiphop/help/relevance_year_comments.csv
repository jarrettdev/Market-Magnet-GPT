10ir3z5,j5g6r1b,Hi-Rezplz,1674417601.0,"Few ways to go about it:Low pass sample to hear the bass notes better > copy notes in MIDI > high pass sample

High pass sample > find root note > play and find minor/major scale of said note

High pass sample to mute bass > lay own bass

Most important thing here is to develop your ear to recognize the (root) note(s) in the sample, which takes practice. Shortcuts such as pitch detection software can work, but like you said it looks goofy and in the \~10% they detect the wrong key you're lost

TL;DR: Either accept looking goofy/pitch detection not being able to save you 10% of times or practice (loads)",18

The fact that you can hear that it sounds
bad means that you should be able to hear what sounds good. 

If the musical theory side is not working for you, just grab a keyboard and play some notes until you find what sounds good to you.",5
10ir3z5,j5k85h9,bleakneon,1674491577.0,"I'll be honest, reading your replies sounds like you have watched too many tutorials and got conflicting advice from them, or not fully understood them.

First off check when you play a C on your keyboard that your 808 plays a C, if you play a D make the 808 is playing a D.

When you say you have the key from melodyne, that is only step 1.  The bass should be related to the notes that are playing when the bass hits.  This is something you could learn from theory, but really you should probably do a bit of trial and error and see what works, if it sounds bad, it is bad.  


Also consider that anything that is telling you the key of a sample could be wrong.

&#x200B;

Here is what I would suggest, not going to get you great tracks, but just get you heading in the right direction.  Using a piano make a simple chord sequence, A minor, C major, F major, G major.  Throw whatever drums on it.  This sequence is could be in C major, or A minor.  Try playing a bassline with just As, try with just Cs.  Really think about how the As and Cs sound under each chord.  Then try with different notes, As under the Aminor, Cs under the Cmajor, Fs under the Fmajor, Gs under the Gmajor.  How does this sound?  Maybe try combining the two, so if you thought the A also sounded good under the Fmajor, and the C sounded good under the Gmajor, try throwing a few of them in.  Then you can start getting wild with any notes from the scale.  Then if you really want to go crazy you can try notes from outside the scale...but this will be getting very weird for bass lines...As I said, this isn't really to get a great beat, just to get you experimenting with things rather than, as you said ""following all the directions"".",5
