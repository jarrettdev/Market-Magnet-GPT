11x7bqj,jd6dsl4,DlackBick,1679456985.0,"I think the vocal mix is the most obvious thing that could be improved, but while the flow was really dope, I would look for ways you could tighten up your subject matter. Keep the thinking on the track concise so that if someone is listening to the track they can say ""I'm listening to it to hear X"" and X can be bars about money, introspective thoughts, etc. The beat is very fun in the same vein as The Neptunes, so I think this could be a nice little party track

11x7bqj,jd6alzc,DlackBick,1679455237.0,"""Forgive me Father, for I have sinned"" is a really dope start to a verse. The bar at 1:01 felt a bit forced and shoehorned in, I would've cut out a few of those words and ended the verse on a really high note. Sorry to hear about your Dads passing! Glad to see that you're channeling your emotions into art. The beat feels very old-school, like something I would've heard Big L rap on and I applaud you for keeping that real sound alive

11x7bqj,jd6faz1,DlackBick,1679457866.0,"Beat drop on this was cool, and I'm liking the more poetic delivery still. Vocal mix could use some work, mainly some vocal compression in my opinion.

11x7bqj,jd68neu,DlackBick,1679454225.0,"This feels like some Ethereal. Retro feel during the bridge at 1:30 -- the main keys synth feels like a 90s infomercial, not sure how else to describe it, it feels like a nice vaporwave style of music.

11x7bqj,jd6cmwp,DlackBick,1679456329.0,"Instrumental feels very emotional from that intro. You can tell that once the beat drops the verse will be intense just by the way the beat comes in.

Nice bounce but the energy feels like it oscillates in this weird mid-point. I don't mean that as a critique, that's what I like. It doesn't commit to any one mood which makes it a very versatile beat. Mix wise I think it's as professional as they come. That ""uhh"" drop is real nice, good use of the vox

11x7bqj,jd4swsw,United-Version1367,1679432153.0,I think the biggest downfall of this beat was the sound selection.

11x7bqj,jd67nds,DlackBick,1679453721.0,"Flute on this has a ""storybook"" feel to it. Feels like going on a legitimate journey with some protagonists. The bass on it is pretty nice, but it does feel a bit muddy. I also think the snare sounds a bit out of place, I would've gone with something with a bit more ""snap"" and brightness to it. I like that the flute feels like it's constantly progressing but I would've used some keys to add in another prominent main instrument

Lmk what you think: https://soundcloud.com/astrorockit/blackjack-aces",1
11x7bqj,jd7vks0,DecDub,1679493431.0,I think you could work on the sound selection. The flute melody is fine but I think the sound it’s self isn’t great. I’m only listening through my phone but the mix isn’t too bad. I might try layer a snare with some more higher end in it and maybe lower the hi hats a little. I think maybe some hi hat rolls on some off beats might sound good too.,1
11x7bqj,jd1x74q,deformedeye,1679380142.0,"It's a pretty good track overall, one thing I would maybe mess around with is the swing of the beat and possibly increase the bpm a bit and maybe space out the 808 a bit more.   


But like I said overall it's a solid beat :)",1
11x7bqj,jd6emxo,DlackBick,1679457467.0,"The melodies on this feel very cinematic. I like how it feels like I'm listening to a villains really well-produced theme music on this beat.

When you listen into the actual vocals you can tell that something about it feels ""off"" from the beat, which means that you should lean more into making the vocals feel weird. Play with the pan, add in some whisper effects so that the words trail a little bit. Experiment with it. Beat wise I really like that kick-drum. Feels like it's trying to kick the door down.

11x7bqj,jd4ukqs,United-Version1367,1679432779.0,"I liked this beat, especially the guitar element. I think that the 808 had a nice and fitting tone. The high hat and clap sound could maybe be replaced with a snare and counter snare to add to a drill vibe you were going for. Nice beat overall!",1
11x7bqj,jd2enlf,REiVibes,1679395278.0,"Neat, definitely very different from a lot of stuff I hear on here. I wasn’t really getting a “drill” feel. I didn’t notice much of a bass or 808, maybe just a sub? Not that you have to have an 808 lol it just didn’t have the typical 808 slides or anything that I associate with drill. I liked it though and thought it had a pleasant, intriguing sound.

11x7bqj,jd6bpqn,DlackBick,1679455824.0,"I definitely hear the drill when listening to the drum patterns. I think this is a bit more experimental than ambient tho. That repeating glass-synth pattern is really nice and adds to the overall neo-Tokyo atmosphere of the beat. I like how well the Eastern influence carries over into the music.

11x7bqj,jd2ag0u,bigeelz,1679391873.0,"This type of beat seems like it would be pretty easy to rap over. If you want things to sound less boring i would say just start messing with the beat so it sounds different or when it starts to feel boring find a way to switch it up. 

My personal opinion is if you're making a beat don't worry about making it reach a certain point. Just end the track when it feels like nothing is being added beyond that point/ When it starts becoming repetitive. Just my opinion - not a real rule to follow. 

Also maybe go back and think about fx sound, background sound - where can you drop sounds/drums/melody elements etc.

I have something a little different for you to hear

11x7bqj,jd6dkk3,DlackBick,1679456857.0,"The fusion of rap and R&B here is nice. While I like the aggressive punchy 808, I think that you could've pulled it back a bit so that the track doesn't go too heavily in the rap-side since it has crossover appeal. The instrumentation itself, especially that main piano melody, feels like I'm getting ready to listen to an R&B singer come on. Mix-wise it sounds great, and the actual pattern of the 808s are phenomenal

11x7bqj,jd6fz7l,Buddymaster39449,1679458269.0,"If it makes you feel better, this sounds miles better than any of my beats. I like the overall sound of this though. The chords are very nice,  and I like how deep the bass/808s sound. I also like the transition between the hook and the verse. Definitely try sending this to rappers and see what happens",1
11x7bqj,jd6ecjd,DlackBick,1679457301.0,"Beat fits so elegantly over the lyrics. Sounds like a truly original track. The chorus with the singing of ""hey papi"" fits extremely well over the melody and the synth-bell melody you have over that section accentuates it. Taking out the melody on JAY's second verse and then switching it up a bit was a great stylistic choice. You've got it with this one

11x7bqj,jd3i0e1,MC_R3b3L,1679414417.0,"the beat is fat, man its def cold like you made the chorus hit nice too. Vocals could be a tad louder but REALLY The only thing i can think of is it would be cool if you had the beat matching the bars a bit more like you did on jays 2nd verse at the end.  This is dope man Good work FR.

11x7bqj,jd43l0r,JOEXZORO,1679422602.0,Thank you! I been trying to work on lyrics a lot! Glad you enjoyed :),1
11x7bqj,jd45wut,JOEXZORO,1679423488.0,"Yee i think i could get a little darker on the delivery, ty im glad you liked it!

Its kinda neither for me, def dont hate it, but its not at bop it lvl yet for me. I like the vibe and ideas but i dont think the mix and delivery bring it together enough yet. Some richer tones/vocal texture or layers or vocal effects, and some harder hitting dynamics in the beat could be good ways to add.",1
11x7bqj,jd4bag9,JOEXZORO,1679425519.0,"I liked the rapping especially, the beat was a little distracting but overall i got like a starting out contra vibe, so pretty sick.   
I wish my homies rapped lol",1
11x7bqj,jd44xp6,JOEXZORO,1679423116.0,"Thanks!! I feel it, those are the two things id like to focus on most, getting all the ideal tones and then ofc a much better master.

youre doing your thing, id enjoy if your projection was held a little more. In the song the end is near by absoul and mac miller, abs verse is a great example of this. macs too but ab soul has this frequency thats more distinct and i think closeish to where youre hitting",1
11x7bqj,jd4wk1z,bigeelz,1679433530.0,pretty great indie pop track. not really my vibe but its sounds great to me.,1
11x7bqj,jd87en7,Simon_WilsonAyer,1679498197.0,"Thank you. Yeah I agree about the bar at 1:01, when I said “put your balls in my insoles” I meant to put the balls of your feet in my shoes but only if you have the balls too but no it was definitely pushed. I’ll check your music out in a few dude, I’m at school rn 🤙",1
11x7bqj,jd39mq4,Simon_WilsonAyer,1679411137.0,I like it. I fuck with the vibe. I would switch up the lyrics to make it flow on the beat more and make it so you can hear the words better. Other than that it’s pretty dope bro,1
11x7bqj,jd7830o,M_Extrano,1679480488.0,"thanks man, appreciate it 🙏

your song is dope, i like the vibes! the bilingual hook is super catchy and your rap sounds good man. those super fast flows are fun, but could be a bit more on point I think. beat is fire too, good job🔥",1
11x7bqj,jd7acla,M_Extrano,1679482193.0,"thanks bro. that goosebumps remix is crazy haha, fire! sounds really aggressive and high energy to me, dope bounce! I think the mix could be a bit cleaner, the bass is a a bit too loud. besides that, its a dope remix 🔥",1
11x7bqj,jd78mus,M_Extrano,1679480920.0,"thanks bro

yours is wavy man, i like that bounce. mix sounds punchy and clean too. i think maybe could have a bridge or b-part, like 8 bars filtered or something like that at some point, but other than that i dont know what could be improved. dope job, left you a follow 👏",1
11x7bqj,jd7arv0,M_Extrano,1679482489.0,">The main melody has a real playful aesthetic to it that pairs well with the more international sounding afro-beat drums and guitar. Bringing in the snaps at 1:15 was nice as it changes up the pacing a little bit. Very romantic feeling listening to this

thanks Astro 🙏

dope song, you're getting better and better for sure. super dope that you produce your own beats, gives you a distinct sound man! beat is cool, fire bounce, mix sounds good, nice work mane🔥",1
11x7bqj,jd78zu9,M_Extrano,1679481197.0,thanks for the feedback 🙏,1
11x7bqj,jd792rz,M_Extrano,1679481260.0,"thanks a lot man, appreciate it!",1
11x7bqj,jd7iyiw,aquariusistheman,1679487470.0,Guess you’re a racist for liking blue faces haha. And the acid line really got me too. Lyrically it’s just dope I think. I love the backup vocals on the hook. Your flow and delivery one of a kind too. Yeah I was using a shitty mic I’m getting a new one on Thursday on mine!!  Thanks!,1
11x7bqj,jdwmpu6,The_Moth44,1679943555.0,"Much appreciated 🙏🏽 thanks for listening my guy

I really enjoyed your track, it has a nice bounce to it in addition to the flow . I definitely like the spacey feel it has to it while still keeping a subtle gritty bass throughout the song. Clean mix too man very solid 🙌🏽",1
11x7bqj,jdt7wa3,Onitaro,1679876528.0,"Hey what up Astro! Sorry for the late ass reply. Another solid track my man. You're always hella consistent with your work. Solid lyricism, nice production, solid mixing. I'd still love to see a flow switch that isn't a hook though, I'm itching to see you do that in one of your next tracks lol. Can't wait to hear the next one my man!",1
11x7bqj,jd9t5k4,dfernand23,1679520041.0,"thanks man. ur track is killer really. i love ur flow and also the beat goes hard man.

 can imagine your flow & voice on  boom bap beats would kill everything",1
11x7bqj,jd4c23s,dfernand23,1679425815.0,"hahaha. i feel u man.

ur sound is dope man. i enjoyed it!!",1
11x7bqj,jd4c79b,dfernand23,1679425869.0,"sure i made it. 

dope style you have, keep it up man!

do",1
11x7bqj,jd6fiad,Buddymaster39449,1679457987.0,"I like the trippy production on this song. The way you ride the beat sounds very authentic, I like how energetic the hook is. Your rhyme schemes sound good, and I like your braggadocios bars. I feel like the vocals are too forward in the mix, but that's my only critique. I guess it would be cool if your next song had a stronger message/ subject matter to it.

Keep doing your thing",1
11x7bqj,jd811i9,Brzux,1679495677.0,"really interesting style, not heard that often nowadays. i like the instrumental but i feel like vocal is a little too loud. besides that honestly don't know what to say else. good luck and keep grinding!",1
11x7bqj,jd7crvr,KB0xx,1679483844.0,"Thanks for the listen and feedback! 

Production on this sounds good I like the all the synths in the beat. Everything sounds good how it should, though stylistically I like the vocal to be tucked more away and washed out, it’s very in your face and the instrumental feels small. But I’m a producer not a rapper lol. Catchy hook and like your energy",1
11x7bqj,jd2opdo,deformedeye,1679401658.0,"I'm not gonna lie, the drums give me a post-punk kinda vibe which I think is really cool. Plus your vocals kind of remind me of little peep which also isn't a bad things since that was one of his bigger strengths imo. Really good track all around imo",1
11x7bqj,jd6oknp,deformedeye,1679464145.0,"Idk if you've ever listened to lil ugly mane but your voice reminds me a bit of his just a little higher. Which is a good thing cause I love ugly mane, plus your voice fits well with that dark kinda beat. I would probably increase the volume on the hit hats and snare a bit myself but all in all it's a pretty dope track",1
11x7bqj,jd2wqgk,SWYLD,1679405633.0,Ay thanks for the feedback! Appreciate you 🙌 do you have any music that I could check out? Socials to follow?,1
11x7bqj,jd2n6e7,DecDub,1679400819.0,The horns and hi hats are really. And I really like the other melody that comes in when the horns get filtered. The mix seems really nice too. But I could only listen through my phone. It ends a bit suddenly though. Other than that it sounds really good!,1
11x7bqj,jd2mth4,DecDub,1679400617.0,The guitar melody is really nice. The fast flow in Spanish is really nice. But I think the vocal is too loud.,1
11x7bqj,jd7w201,DecDub,1679493635.0,I think the vocals are mixed a little too loud. Other than that it sounds pretty good to me. The chorus is a little to repetitive for me but that’s just a preference thing.,1
11x7bqj,jd7jjoa,Ballvoyage,1679487782.0,"That's great to hear, I appreciate it! Sorry I got really just but will listen to your track soon and let you know",1
11x7bqj,jdd43w2,Ballvoyage,1679584750.0,"Great tune again man. Everything about your vocals is great: flow, lyrics, the mix. I like the beat, the bass hits hard! The only thing is I was hoping that the beat would pick up in energy at some stage, maybe even just layering a snare over that clap for the last verse and chorus would give it a lift. That is probably just a matter of taste though!",1
11x7bqj,jddc4cz,Ballvoyage,1679587808.0,"I like the vibe man! I really like the contrast between the chorus and verses, every time you start rapping in Spanish it goes hard. The vocals are a little hard to hear in the mix sometimes and I think I'd prefer it if there was more rapping and less singing in the verses. Your singing sounds great btw I just really like the rapping! Keep at it, I'm definitely interested to hear more",1
11x7bqj,jd7jpnl,Ballvoyage,1679487869.0,"Eyy thank you, really glad you like it! Sorry I posted my track and then got super busy all of a sudden but will listen to your track soon and let you know what I think",1
11x7bqj,jd5z679,MC_R3b3L,1679449765.0,Thank your for listening. I def know its rough but its one of the first tracks i did on this path im on idk trying to work something out but its really tricky. Hope my next track is more of a bop.,1
11x7bqj,jd4p0ge,thatdudechandler,1679430705.0,"It took them 4-5 years to finally rap lol. Thanks for the feedback though, I appreciate it",1
11x7bqj,jd46dia,Simon_WilsonAyer,1679423666.0,Yeah my mix and my projection are the things I’ve been working on. Thank you for the feedback!,1
11x7bqj,jd7lbfi,MC_R3b3L,1679488699.0,Thank you for listening. Yeeeah this was my first try at something new. The singing and fast bars need work but i just needed to get this out so i can progress. I will work to make my next release a better bop hope i can make one nice enough to hit the replay lol again thank you.,1
