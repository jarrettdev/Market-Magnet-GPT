Here's a verse i'm working on that's part of a collaboration. It's a bit different in tone from the style of your track, but I would love to hear any and all feedback you have, especially parts where you feel I can improve my flow delivery: [https://on.soundcloud.com/jrnMd](https://on.soundcloud.com/jrnMd)",1

Nice stuff",1
127apw9,jee7s4k,th3m4g3,1680262280.0,"Delivery is fine, but you're missing something in the vocal FX. Make sure you utilize EQ, Compression, and a little reverb. Compression is key to modern rap vocals and EQ is absolutely necessary. 

I like your bars, it's creative but too complex where I personally wouldn't bump it in the car because it's not my style of rap, but it's good nonetheless and don't take that to heart use it to guide your creative process. Are you making music for yourself, for others to hear, or for the radio?

127apw9,jei6xhz,DlackBick,1680326938.0,"Beat drop on this was dope, my immediate notice was that everything felt thin but when the bass comes in the entire mix fleshed out. I like how lively the melody feels on this one, particularly because of the percussion you used and sampled voices. In addition, using two different bass elements creates two distinct ""sections"" of the beat which is really cool. This feels like J Cole's version of ""Trophies"", I like the ""victory"" mood on the beat

I just checked out your track, I think there are some things that can be polished up but there are some solid ideas here. I think your biggest area to focus on is your sound, delivery, and flow. Hiding behind an auto-tune can't fix everything and I think with some practice you'll be on your way. Try to get a better sense of the tempo while rapping so you stay in the pocket. Some more energy as well as some inflection and cadence work will also help with your performance. Keep it up my man!",1

Your track goes hard. Really nice. I like the chorus - easy to remember and easy to sing along. The beat/song could use a little bit of variety/switch up, cause it feels too monotonous after a while. Some switch up in the beat and the flow would be dope imo. Other than that, really good.",1
