Feedback on the Remix; These vocals fit over the beat even better than I expected. The way that the verse comes on out of nowhere is extremely dope and just adds to that slowed-up R&B vibe. The fact that Offset is coming with traditional trap lyrics but the beat is softer creates this beautiful contrast that I wish more mainstream hip-hop took advantage of.

The way that you all fed off each other on that second verse was dope. You both have that ""sinister"" lowkey in-the-gutter flow that works but do it with stylistic differences. I had to rewind just to hear that handoff again because her verse was really hitting its crescendo and then you jump in and take it over. Beat is ill, and is brash yet mixed good. I say that because you'd expect a ton of clipping but the beat doesn't feel harsh to listen to. Great use of guitar melodies

129amq9,jenzghl,FindingAwake,1680447163.0,"Dope sample - I really like the chop, and it definitely would inspire me to write some bars about love or something that happened in life. With that said, the beat doesn't really sound complete. When I first started hearing it, my thought was ""this is gonna be a banger"" when the drums and the bass hit... it never drops. There are tracks on hiphop that are like that so it isn't a bad thing, but my expectation for what it was I was listening to was off. Part of me is like ""I can't really give good feedback"" on this because it's like asking me to judge a house off of the materials that aren't fully assembled yet. To be real though, good sample for a story telling beat, but it needs something more to it I think. Or maybe it just needs the lyrics. Hope to hear about it again in the future.",1

I did wish there was more Kelis sampled here, but I'll take what I can get. I like the melody on it, I think you went a bit too ""mechanical""/industrial here. The soft piano notes that come in around 3:00 should've been more prevalent, same with some softer strings and pads.

The most crucial detail I'd think about amending would be the lack of some essential components in instrument selection. What you made felt ""empty"" after a while, as I couldn't really hear any continuing synths/pads, which would make your music more ""full"".

The beat is interesting too, and I think with some louder 808s it'd be a banger. The main 808s are just way too quiet. Other than that, my only critique is that I don't know who you're dissing so that always makes it hard to judge the lyrical quality

I think it's nice to what your process, but I would've loved to just hear the beat play out in full, I really do like the sampled melody you've got going on.

I think that for the chorus you should've added in more variation with the lyrics and expanded on the initial idea of women being strange. I think that if the beat dropped and a complete switch-up came in, that'd be really ill. This is the most comfortable I've heard you on a track so far. Great work

Kept me engaged tho. When the pitch bend ""holy gates legendary"" chant first came in, I didn't really have a lot of positive thought about what it was I was about to experience. I was like ""oh man... this is gonna be bad."" So when the drums hit and you started rapping, and it was dope, I was like ""whew."" You're good at what you do but that pre verse chant thing needs to be revamped somehow. Not sure how because I'm not exactly on point with that you're trying to convey with it but the rest of the song is spot on. 

&#x200B;

Take this with a grain of salt though as sometimes things like that grow on me over time. Kendrick Lamar has like several examples of hitting my ear weird the first time I heard him do it and now I'm like 10000 percent with whatever weird thing he wants to do.",1

The hazy, acid-tingey organ that's playing here is real dope. Track definitely feels like festival music, and I could imagine an arena full of people going absolutely crazy to it.

The beat-drop at the ""like I think about you"" bar was ill, and really shows your talent to work with the beat as an artist. Feels like you deliberately structure lyrics and certain bars to play along with the beat for added effect. Great use of background vocals too, a lot of DIY R&B musicians leave those off for some reason, but they're arguably just as, if not more, important as the lead vocals. The beat at 2:45 when it's just the drum break and the synth was fantastic. This is an A+ song. Like someone else said, I get Dru Hill vibes from this one
