I like your bars, it's creative but too complex where I personally wouldn't bump it in the car because it's not my style of rap, but it's good nonetheless and don't take that to heart use it to guide your creative process. Are you making music for yourself, for others to hear, or for the radio?

Mix is pretty alright too, a little muddy but that might just be the lo-fi aesthetic. The final switch up wasn't my favorite, bass at the end was a little intense, but great work man. Keep it up my!

Here's the third song off of my new EP, hope you like it!

127apw9,jedtozw,Filiphaggblom,1680251168.0,"Super creative drums. Really like everything about this track. If a try to find anything I would've changed it would be the distorted bass in the end, it needs a bit more life/saturation. I don't know, it's not that big of a deal. You should be proud, stellar track!",1
127apw9,jee050x,M_Extrano,1680256765.0,"Beat is fire man, I love the bounce! Those soul keys (i guess its a sample) are dope and it sounds really clean. Beat switch is crazy too, even tho you mentioned it here I didnt expect it haha. Good work fam, this is hard!

127apw9,jeh6p2q,mcAlt009,1680307694.0,Definitely love how dark it is. The grimy hats work so well here. It creeps in perfectly. Feels more like a soundtrack vs a rap beat though. Like I'm imagining a horror movie when listening to this.,1
127apw9,jedy375,TheMangoMan44,1680255037.0,"Absolutely dark just how I like it. Especially enjoyed the pulsing triple drums at 0:57, was like a little treat for the ears. I don't know if it's just my headphones or the mix, but I would love to hear that bass a little louder, i'm a glutton for loud bass. Overall though I think you've done an outstanding job and I would love to hear more.

Here's a verse i'm working on that's part of a collaboration. It's a bit different in tone from the style of your track, but I would love to hear any and all feedback you have, especially parts where you feel I can improve my flow delivery: [https://on.soundcloud.com/jrnMd](https://on.soundcloud.com/jrnMd)",1

127apw9,jeflaj8,Onitaro,1680283740.0,"Hey man I really really like that vocal sample at the beginning, I think the transition is way too jarring though. It could also use some gain staging so the change isn't so intense. A lot of good ideas here though man, I think your delivery and sound could use a little work, developing sound takes time though. I think the second half of the track is better than the first half as well. Keep it up my man!

127apw9,jeebvnc,phreakyzekey,1680264679.0,"This beat is dope, it sounds pretty different than a lot of what I hear and that def grabbed my attention. It’s a bit hard to make out what you’re saying, I would try to cut some mid/lower freq, the flow sounds good buts it’s really hard to understand what you’re saying. Good place to start just keep polishing!

127apw9,jedz1ty,REiVibes,1680255857.0,"Really pretty cool song and really cool ideas here. Your flow and delivery is really sweet on here and meshes well with the beat imo. The vocals felt a little bit muddy to me but I also liked the way they were mixed in other ways. Cool track overall, really different sound.

127apw9,jei55us,DlackBick,1680325722.0,"That cover art is real dope! I'm liking the aesthetic. The track is very interesting. It has some nice punk rock aesthetics, while the sample completely slows things down and comes in a little softer. Autotune section at the end was really dope, and really piqued my interest. Beat is very interesting, I think at certain sections you can pare back some elements and go a bit more minimalist with everything

127apw9,jei6hxz,DlackBick,1680326632.0,"Kicks on this are real electric. I like how invigorating the sound of your drums are, reminds me a lot of when I first heard JetsonMade. I'm diggin how minimalist the melody feels. Doesn't feel like you packed a lot just for the sake of adding a lot in. Everything here feels kinda lowkey and fits well together. Nice style too, definitely has Trap influences but feels like it's in its own lane

127apw9,jefyvd4,OBtz2kT,1680289104.0,"This is good for being your fourth beat. I would work on the mix and just level the sounds out more. Maybe add some more variation to melody and drums, maybe add a hihat for some more bounce. Keep it up!

127apw9,jedyrq8,REiVibes,1680255615.0,"Pretty cool beat, reminds me a bit of Kanye’s production for some reason. It’s a bit short but I could see it being turned into a beat to be used for a song, I think it could use a few more elements though to make it a bit less bare.

127apw9,jedydve,REiVibes,1680255292.0,"I dig the lyrics and message of it a lot, really solid delivery. I think the mix was quite solid too, listening on iPhone speakers though which can be deceiving, but to me it sounded really clear and I liked the effects on your vocals. Great work!

I really like the opening bars, it quickly introduces the listener to the concepts of what the track is going to be about. I also like the flow around 1:15, sounds like you really found your pocket there. ""My biggest enemy was me when I felt so depressed"" -- very real lyrics that a lot of people can identify with

127apw9,jedxi6r,FeatureOriginal6266,1680254532.0,Thanks again bro ... Your verse sounds good to me good vocal tone sounds confident Lyricism good as well keep going with it,1

127apw9,jemlwxr,singingly,1680412628.0,"Thank you. Hmm, yeah, I could see me dropping an 808 into this, especially if I extended the beat.

Really like the flow here.

I feel like you could punch it up even more with a really well-timed drop, then coming right back in with the flow at some point in this verse.",1
127apw9,jemj8l7,singingly,1680410853.0,"I appreciate it. Thank you much.

You always do good work and this is no exception.

Has that real old school Roland 808 beat machine type vibe.

But with the chill keys.

Dig the album art.

Makes me wanna' do some stuff on my own SP-404.",1
127apw9,jemkgjo,singingly,1680411650.0,"Thank you thank you.

That grimy guitar(?) and the Memphis(?) rap vocal were really nice. Phonk like it's supposed to be done.

Liked, commented, and subscribed.

Hope you do more phonk beats soon.",1

Love your flow on the song and the hook is really catchy as well. I also love overall vibe of the track, kinda reminds me of that old school phonk lil ugly mane type of vibe. Keep it up 🔥🔥!!",1
127apw9,jegb8se,ConclusionPlastic877,1680294049.0,Appreciate the support. Your track is heat beat is nice and unique and bars are on point as always. We definitely gotta work together again,1
127apw9,jehu9qc,Onitaro,1680319221.0,"hey my man thanks so much for the kind words!

I just checked out your track, I think there are some things that can be polished up but there are some solid ideas here. I think your biggest area to focus on is your sound, delivery, and flow. Hiding behind an auto-tune can't fix everything and I think with some practice you'll be on your way. Try to get a better sense of the tempo while rapping so you stay in the pocket. Some more energy as well as some inflection and cadence work will also help with your performance. Keep it up my man!",1
127apw9,jenqm8i,Alexusmo,1680442970.0,"thank you for the detailed feedback!

Your track goes hard. Really nice. I like the chorus - easy to remember and easy to sing along. The beat/song could use a little bit of variety/switch up, cause it feels too monotonous after a while. Some switch up in the beat and the flow would be dope imo. Other than that, really good.",1
127apw9,jenq0f3,Alexusmo,1680442654.0,sorry for the late feedback - beat is very cool. I like the melody. Feels like the melody is giving that beat most of the bounce. Drums are solid but it feels like they are missing a bit of a punch. Maybe add some sidechain compression to the drums so they stand out a bit more.,1
127apw9,jenq7l0,Alexusmo,1680442757.0,"Thanks! 

Its from a sample at wavs.com - check them out, really dope samples there",1

127apw9,jehz6eh,DlackBick,1680321976.0,"Really appreciate you checking it out!! I really like the melodic delivery you brought to the track, it gives the track some personality. I like the chorus a lot, but felt like it took up a large portion of the track, making parts feel like just one large chorus. The vocal mix is really good and sounds professional, and the beat itself is very well produced, especially the synth layers",1
127apw9,jehysvg,DlackBick,1680321759.0,"Thank you, that comment means a lot to me! I'm really liking your flows, you really do sound like a student of the game and I appreciate that. I think if you had a melodic hook, it would really tie the song together really nice. My main critique would be that, and the vocal mix could sound a bit more professional",1
127apw9,jei5djw,OBtz2kT,1680325861.0,Thank you! I'll work on that for sure!,1

127apw9,jeieqc6,tz69,1680332905.0,"I appreciate your feedback, here’s mine:

I really like the drum work, it gives me a nice 3-6 phonk vibe. Your flow is also on point and the vocal mixing is surprisingly good. Did you do it yourself or maybe booked a session? The only thing which sounds a bit weak to me compared to all the other elements is the melody, you should defo work on that but overall it’s nice production!",1
127apw9,jegaygj,CJFMusic,1680293935.0,"This is good, bro. I definitely like the message in the 2nd verse. You gotta have love for your people because you never know. Overall, dope song, the beat is fire, and the mix is solid. What else can you ask for

127apw9,jef1xif,CJFMusic,1680276198.0,"This beat is nice. I think the main melody is too loud, and it's clashing with the drums a bit, but other than that, it's good for what it is 

Thanks for listening",1
127apw9,jeg3ybk,,1680291134.0,"I really like the chill and smooth vibe of this beat, so good work on that. I do agree with the other comment about the main melody being too loud. But overall, smooth sound and nice drums also. Good work bro!

127apw9,jehmyy1,bleakneon,1680315443.0,"This track is cool.  I like the vocals and there are some cool lines in there that I feel I can connect with.   The switches in the flow with the changes in the beat are nice too, I'm not an expert with this stuff, but I feel like the compression or limiting on the master could have been pulled back a little bit.

But overall as a track I think it's a good one",1
127apw9,jegbo5v,Inner-Beat-4647,1680294221.0,"Ty dude! Maybe ill try make some more.Your beat is awesome so vibe🤌 beat, i like the vox and rapping was on point. Keep it up man!",1

I listened your beat from phone. I liked i was able to hear bass. Your beat was pretty dope and has that nice bounce. Nothing to critizise. Keep it up",1
127apw9,jei7j6m,Inner-Beat-4647,1680327365.0,"Ty dude! 

I liked your beat. The lead synth is nice and the vocals have good mix. I think your song is smooth, maybe too smooth? :D maybe add something to it add some exitiment? Maybe open hihat now and there, i dont know :D anyway good beat and u too keep grinding and makeing more!",1
127apw9,jeiqtg6,M_Extrano,1680343510.0,"thanks man, I like your verse, turn it into a full song haha! beat sounds like some DJ Mustard/Tyga type beat, which is dope. looking forward to hear the full version",1

127apw9,jeir7al,M_Extrano,1680343846.0,"Thanks man, appreciate it! This is not so bad as fourth beat tbh, but of course it still sounds amateur-ish. I think the drums just playing on 1 and 2 is very static and boring, maybe try to find a certain bounce, so it makes you wanna move or at least bop your head haha. keep going!",1

127apw9,jehic89,therealsolate,1680313160.0,"Thanks for the listen and feedback bro! 

This is dope overall I think you have a sick verse going. Delivery seems to me to be on point and great, just some mix things aren’t sitting right to my ears but that’s outside of the performance and it’s a WIP. Based off this 30 second snippet it sounds hard man I don’t really have anything to critique for it",1
127apw9,jee652u,TheLd01,1680261239.0,"Thats a vibe right there, a nice beat and solid vocals. The only thing that stood out to me was the doubled vocals sounded a little bit off at one point, cant put my finger on why it just sounds a bit off but other than that quite a unique little vibey tune.",1
