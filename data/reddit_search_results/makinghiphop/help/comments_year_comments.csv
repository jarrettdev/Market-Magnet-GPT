y7a8zf,it3w2fz,Revizionary,1666293230.0,"To be fair most of my subs are from the 90s hip hop compilations I I make. I have been making beats for a long time but only recently started posting them to my channel.  Havoc from mobb deep is probably my biggest inspiration as I like darker boom bap the most.  Along with some others like Buckwild, Beatminerz, DJ Muggs, and of course DJ premier.  Anyway, if you dig the beat I posted check out some of my other beats if you have time, or the 90's mixes and blends I make if you like golden era hip hop.  Thanks for the response, I appreciate it.",1
