I really want to know how to make the beat even harder. I believe I tried all the general tactics like boosting the lows with EQ, saturating and soft clipping, panning channels to make the 808s more heard, etc.

I liked the beat at the start, though it grew a little samey. Maybe introducing some more elements as time goes on could help - or more of the scratch samples early on, giving a bit more space for your lines. This is subjective. What you're doing is solid.",1

The beat-drop at the ""like I think about you"" bar was ill, and really shows your talent to work with the beat as an artist. Feels like you deliberately structure lyrics and certain bars to play along with the beat for added effect. Great use of background vocals too, a lot of DIY R&B musicians leave those off for some reason, but they're arguably just as, if not more, important as the lead vocals. The beat at 2:45 when it's just the drum break and the synth was fantastic. This is an A+ song. Like someone else said, I get Dru Hill vibes from this one

The way that you all fed off each other on that second verse was dope. You both have that ""sinister"" lowkey in-the-gutter flow that works but do it with stylistic differences. I had to rewind just to hear that handoff again because her verse was really hitting its crescendo and then you jump in and take it over. Beat is ill, and is brash yet mixed good.

The most crucial detail I'd think about amending would be the lack of some essential components in instrument selection. What you made felt ""empty"" after a while, as I couldn't really hear any continuing synths/pads, which would make your music more ""full"". It sounds quite boom-bap, and my feedback loses most of its value if you're going for that style, but it would still be good if you added a subtle pad in the background. Great work overall. 🙏",1

I did wish there was more Kelis sampled here, but I'll take what I can get. I like the melody on it, I think you went a bit too ""mechanical""/industrial here. The soft piano notes that come in around 3:00 should've been more prevalent, same with some softer strings and pads.

The beat is interesting too, and I think with some louder 808s it'd be a banger. The main 808s are just way too quiet.

With that said, the beat doesn't really sound complete. When I first started hearing it, my thought was ""this is gonna be a banger"" when the drums and the bass hit... it never drops. There are tracks on hiphop that are like that so it isn't a bad thing, but my expectation for what it was I was listening to was off. Part of me is like ""I can't really give good feedback"" on this because it's like asking me to judge a house off of the materials that aren't fully assembled yet. To be real though, good sample for a story telling beat, but it needs something more to it I think. Or maybe it just needs the lyrics. Hope to hear about it again in the future.",1

Beat obviously reminds me of soulful hip-hop but I love that it isn't just looping but the beat has progression in it. Cover art is amazing and extremely inventive, and the whole track is professionalism. Great work!! Feels like a track that should've been on the Dreamville tape, nothing I would change or add

129amq9,jer3glb,DlackBick,1680498352.0,"Solid beat, I like the kick drum but would've went with something with more of a ""bass-y"" tendency. When all the instrumentation comes in at 1:10, I really started getting into it, especially the bell instrument. The reverb on that instrument is spectacular. The overall groove on the track is nice, doesn't sound like traditional dancehall to me, but I most definitely hear the strong influence

I thought at the end from 1:45 on you could of dropped that bass back in at some point before the end, felt like there was going to be a big finish to the track but it just sort of slowed down at the end. Great work though!

I'm really digging the transition piece at 0:52, I do think you should've done half-time on the drums though and played it over that section. The hazy, acid-tingey organ that's playing here is real dope. Track definitely feels like festival music, and I could imagine an arena full of people going absolutely crazy to it. Def find an artist that can complement the wild energy of this track, yet can still be lyrical. Someone kinda like Logic mixed with Carti

You sound tough lyrics match and you steady on the beat. i like the higher notes thematically too. like how you ride that beat well with the flows cadence an delivery. i think this is exactly what i would imagine when hearing the beat by it self id say you might be too much in the pocket like mf you sound comfortable af on this. i think you did your thing you can spit visuals was a little more abstract then i enjoy come off like stock footage but that could just be me.  but good job overall man.

129amq9,jeo0wua,FindingAwake,1680447817.0,"It turned out I really liked this song once the verses got going, and the visuals that were used were dope, but they didn't always seem to match what was going on the song... though it might be that you were just using this as a YouTube visualizer and not a music video exactly. Kept me engaged tho. When the pitch bend ""holy gates legendary"" chant first came in, I didn't really have a lot of positive thought about what it was I was about to experience. I was like ""oh man... this is gonna be bad."" So when the drums hit and you started rapping, and it was dope, I was like ""whew."" You're good at what you do but that pre verse chant thing needs to be revamped somehow. Not sure how because I'm not exactly on point with that you're trying to convey with it but the rest of the song is spot on. 

&#x200B;

Take this with a grain of salt though as sometimes things like that grow on me over time. Kendrick Lamar has like several examples of hitting my ear weird the first time I heard him do it and now I'm like 10000 percent with whatever weird thing he wants to do.",1

When that beat drops at 2:35, it drops on a perfect line ""never had shit, but a microphone and a bad bitch"" and then the beat goes full-on Mike Dean mode and brings in all the amazing instrumentation

I'm really liking the part at 0:48 when it's just the piano and the 808s & drums, that minimalist section is dope and would allow the artist to place a huge emphasis on their bars.

Feedback on the Remix; These vocals fit over the beat even better than I expected. The way that the verse comes on out of nowhere is extremely dope and just adds to that slowed-up R&B vibe. The fact that Offset is coming with traditional trap lyrics but the beat is softer creates this beautiful contrast that I wish more mainstream hip-hop took advantage of. You're in beast mode with this one!!

Beat is nice and has an emotional core to it, especially on the chorus, the guitar that comes in is really nice. I think on the verse section, would've been nice for you to add in some additional melody, possibly through a synth, just to keep listeners engaged. Otherwise I think it's a dope remix

129amq9,jewhwvr,prod_pxyraz,1680605226.0,"Love the song bro, great vibes. The only relevant thing I can say is to look at mixing kicks and 808s. If you purposely made 808s more emphasized, then it's good but it feels like the space given to kicks is little compared to bass. I suggest using EQ and soft clipping to make the kicks more punchy. You can also just change your preset for kicks, it sometimes helps as well. Dope work overall, really liked it 🙏",1

This a short sweet banger, I like that its ignorant but quirky enough to keep it interesting. I like how you crept in behind the second hook then cut in with your verse. Definitely a late night out on the town up to no good kinda vibe.",1

Thank you for the feedback. Currently don’t have much of a fan base due to that being my second release so I really only get feedback from my engineer and friends. It’s much appreciated.

I enjoyed your song bro. Shits catchy. I’ve listened to it a couple times and I think everything I basically perfect. I think kaybles parts might be a tad high in the volume end. He’s much higher than the Ft artists at least and he has a very powerful voice. I don’t think it would hurt to turn his down a notch. I would bump it in a system to make sure.
