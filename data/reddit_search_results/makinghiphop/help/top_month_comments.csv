11ocbxz,jbz2zkm,DlackBick,1678654609.0,"Hard!! Feels like I'm listening to a 90s gangster movie at the start, and then the entire vibe feels like some classic A$AP Rocky/SGP music. Convinced if those two still worked together, they would rap over this beat and make one of their most fire collabs. The Juicy J sample was perfect",1

11ocbxz,jbtrlkw,Acceptable_Yam4795,1678555636.0,"Gotta work on the sample choice for your drums and work on your programming.  Less is more.  I liked the wandering bassline.  Leave some space in the track to let it come in on its own for a second.  The main sample gets repetitive and you don't have anything on top of it to keep things interesting.  Always be telling a different part of the story.  Doesn't mean you have to use a different sample every few bars but you need to flip them in such a way that the audience craves the pattern.  


Your mix was nice and with a few things changed it can be a legit great track.",1
11ocbxz,jbuzlxx,cliu813,1678574770.0,"this is dope.. the melody sounds bad ass.. I like the dark trap vibess..  its goes hard too.. the 808s sound good.. kicks is nice too..  the melody is simple but creates a chillin mood..  mix sound good to  me..  overall this got some dope hard trap vibes.

Not too heavy of a focus on lyrical bars, just enjoying the energy of the track and getting sucked into the whole energy. Flow switch-up at 1:48 was very welcome and done extremely well, I like the simple ""loose"" style of the rhymes, reminds me of 2014-era Drake. Great work

That explosive drum loop preparing for the beat to drop really gets the body moving and sets things off on the right foot. Very unique take on the Southern style by adding in little samples and scratches. Great track

the beat sounds sick first of all, love all of those reverse sounds that were used, sounds pretty dark and gloomy. Your rap sounds good too, I think its a bit too dry tho.
