zywyvr,j288vpg,Spidergollem,1672395453.0,"There's not really a right answer for this. I studied digital marketing and know several strategies of how you can promote anything online.

I once created a website where I'd write some music news. One day I wrote an article named ""Top 10 rappers in Portugal"" and I threw myself in the middle. I then applied SEO techniques so my page would come up on the first results of Google when someone searched ""top 10 rappers Portugal"".

This just to say, learn a little bit of digital marketing and then use your creativity to reach out new audience. My advice for you is to learn social media marketing as everyone know how to use social media and is a good point to start",3
zywyvr,j28flrg,HCTDMCHALLENGER,1672400746.0,"Best to promote on instagram, that works for me. Try and get people to follow or listen to your music from school and the workplace and if your music is good they will share with people.",2
zywyvr,j28kve0,digitaldisgust,1672404360.0,Spotify and Apple Music if you can afford to have them distributed to both.,2
zywyvr,j2ii86h,Itzsaykridd,1672589884.0,"I don't think there is a right answer.

#1 don't pay for views/streams lol.

Meet people, go to shows, introduce yourself, giving out cds/usb's/business cards.
Interact with more people online, post more content, get more followers.

Personally, I think insta, fb and tiktok are they best for promo.
My insta is more towards other artists/supports. Fb is more towards my work friends, friends and not so much the ""fans"", tiktok is for brand new people.

It's alot with algorithms, I have a group of people on insta where we all show love to each others posts interactions. Boosts the algorithms",1
zywyvr,j2iw2hg,ParticularOk4000,1672595876.0,"Set up your social media is a very important, make sure everything is in place.  
Don't do paid ads on social , they are complete waste of your money.  
Use digital distrubution to get your music on Spotify, Apple music, Tidal etc...  
I've tried them for a while and nothing happened.  
I recommend getting your music on Spotify playlists, blogs, TikTok influencers... use a submission platforms like One Submit or Soundsphare, they are legit to get some real streams...  
bear in mind, it takes time. good luck",1
zywyvr,j28aqp0,milkycrops,1672396978.0,"Thank you, do you have any advice for real life by chance too? 

Also replying to what you wrote, I was thinking about that and wondering how I should even go about it cause I'm not social media savvy at all. I mean I make reddit memes but not too many subs allow self promotion and even so I don't know where to post music to share to begin with. Would you know any places where I can upload my tracks?",1
zywyvr,j2b7mcm,milkycrops,1672443449.0,"I Instagram makes sense! Did you just post it there or did you advertise it to people on Instagram? If you use Instagram for advertising, how did you go about it? I appreciate the real life advice too by the way thanks!",1
zywyvr,j2b7rc3,milkycrops,1672443505.0,"do you have to pay to have your music on them? I thought they just took a cut of profits. Also, do they even promote music? I thought it was just like a library. How would I go about getting my music promoted there?",1
zywyvr,j2jx8oi,milkycrops,1672610409.0,Those are some good tips my guy thank you so much! I was actually wondering if it'd be good to pay for exposure lol but you right it's best to do it naturally and not waste money. I'll definitely set up cards and CDs tho that's a good idea to get my demo out once I get it ready. Appreciate the help man!,1
zywyvr,j2jxgwm,milkycrops,1672610501.0,"I appreciate the luck man, thank you for all the recommendations and for going into detail I appreciate it! I definitely won't waste cash on ads but I'll look I to one sumbit and soindshpare like you mentioned",1
zywyvr,j28b4u3,Spidergollem,1672397297.0,"For real life it's all about connections. Going to other local artists shows, talking with them, being genuine. That's literally the better way.

I've been lacking on the connections since COVID but I know this is just the best way. I have another local rapper (which we know each other for some time now) and his music isn't anything special but he put in the work. He went outside and met a bunch of people and now he's working with people that have their name stablished in the industry here. 

Just go outside to places where you think there's going to be people that share your interest in music. Idk look for open mic sessions and spit some bars.

To upload your tracks you can look for ""distro kid"" it's a platform that allows you to publish your tracks to a lot of streaming platforms such as Instagram library, Spotify, Apple Music, etc.

Other than that, if you're looking for a place where you publish your song for promoting purposes to start creating an audience, I don't think there's anything and it also wouldn't be really helpful unless your music is a universal banger",2
zywyvr,j2cq4if,HCTDMCHALLENGER,1672470773.0,"Use ads if you can. I find people like to check insta stories, leave a link or something there. Basically just promote say ‚Äúmy new song is out tomorrow 5pm, make sure to cehck it out‚Äù stuff like that. Tease people with it, post snippets. Insta is really good for building a fan base, all the artists use it.",1
zywyvr,j2cq4zp,HCTDMCHALLENGER,1672470783.0,Also utilise tiktok,1
zywyvr,j2cyvg4,digitaldisgust,1672477573.0,"Youre gonna have to Google it to make sure, I dont have anything on streaming yet so I cant help there lol

But distributors allow for you to get your music on Spotify, Apple Music etc.",1
zywyvr,j2kqfhb,Itzsaykridd,1672622834.0,"You can pay for thousands of views/streams but they get you nowhere when them views/streams are bots/fake or not real 'supporters'.
If you do want to pay for advertisement, I definitely do recommend it but being the right way, the organic way.",1

zywyvr,j2d7blu,milkycrops,1672484640.0,How would I go about that? Like make memes and all and put my song on it? Would I need to have my song on a streaming platform for that? I appreciate the help by the way my guy!,1
zywyvr,j2d7d6s,milkycrops,1672484676.0,Ah okay lol I appreciate the help though! I'll look into distributors!,1
