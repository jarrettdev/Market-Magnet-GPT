11mwe75,jbk44ii,104848,1678380820.0,"what do you mean how is sounds?   you talking loudness?

and you said you used 2 of the 5 slots... havent you already released music on spotify?",1
11mwe75,jbkusci,skinnyfamilyguy,1678390756.0,Every platform has loudness normalization on by default,1
11mwe75,jbn9zzy,662Mane,1678431397.0,How can you add artist to distrokid account is that a specific plan,1
11mwe75,jbna2q6,662Mane,1678431451.0,Just don’t pay for loudness normalization that distrokid offers when uploading tracks. It’s not worth it and even if your master is too low it won’t fix it too much,1
11mwe75,jbr5wti,DramaticPineapple681,1678499481.0,"I'd wait until it goes on sale, or if you have a voucher for a discount. But this plugin does exactly that. https://www.plugin-alliance.com/en/products/adptr\_streamliner.html",1
11mwe75,jbl0l5x,MasterHeartless,1678392944.0, [LUFS.org](https://lufs.org) is also a good option. It is actually very accurate.,1
11mwe75,jbk82wh,dancetoken,1678382307.0,"yes, the other two artist slots I used are EDM tracks that I purchased from producers (i did not produce those tracks)

I guess I want to see how it sounds in comparison to other instrumentals on spotify, etc.

I decided to go ahead and do it, as I lose nothing doing this and i'm underutilizing my distrokid plan",1
11mwe75,jbkzjig,dancetoken,1678392551.0,"yea, i actually turned normalization off yesterday (spotify) ... some tracks sound interesting with it off.

So just gonna experiment and see how the beat sounds on spotify with normalization on, and off, and all that",2
11mwe75,jbncb9d,dancetoken,1678433087.0,"yea , i signed up years ago but i remember it being the second tier plan they offered",1
