uyzxg6,iabdbba,IntroductionOnly3417,1653747678.0,The little flickrs in this are well placed. The drums feel too lackluster. Give me more umph with your drums and bass. Keep grinding,2
uyzxg6,iabdhcu,IntroductionOnly3417,1653747761.0,This smooth. I could hear some fast rap over some shit like this. The snares get grating a bit. I like the vocal in it a lot. Keep going.,1
uyzxg6,iabdt2n,IntroductionOnly3417,1653747920.0,"The whistling in this cool. Video effects cool. Your flow slips off in a couple parts in the first verse. You can rap, I'd like to see more of your musical direction. You gave braggy vibes but I think you can do other things too and I'd like to see it. Keep making music",1

uyzxg6,iabe553,IntroductionOnly3417,1653748084.0,This gives me proof and em vibes. Rip proof. You rapping. This old school vibes fit you. your vocals loud enough but sound too thin. I'd like to hear them sit as more of the main stay in the mix. This second and 3rd verse sound more clear than the first. I just peep this something from 2012. I was like 3 verses!? I fw this lol. Keep grinding.,1
uyzxg6,iabeljq,IntroductionOnly3417,1653748305.0,This feels too abstract to play round the baddies😂 your bop was all over the place. I fw the deep vocals. And the outro shit talking. Please make more traditional music to go along w your abstract shit 😂. This made me get bug eyes at first 😂. Keep making music,1

uyzxg6,ia7gbkk,almighd,1653666970.0,"That actually isn't me, that's Hopsin's biggest influence. I'm more quick to promote him than I am with my own music because he's so underground it physically pains me nobody knows him. I do have a song with him on my upcoming project though.

uyzxg6,ia7m0uz,Frediinho,1653669288.0,"Appreciate you taking the time man. 

Although the focus is more on rhyme schemes, the bars are all references to selling and doing acid/chro. Psyches are kinda my thing.

‘Off This Ish’ - ‘ish’ being acid and chronic.

Hearing you say that about the beat is dope though cuz I made it starting with an mp3 I clipped from an anime. Didn't know if the vibe would translate",1
uyzxg6,ia82r7h,TazzM90,1653676345.0,Nope not on purpose lol but definitely experimental and still learning. Complete DIY artist. I’m heavily influenced by many genres. I’ve always said a cross between the late Kurt Cobain and JuiceWrld. I appreciate you taking the time out to listen and review.,1
uyzxg6,ia82yxu,TazzM90,1653676437.0,Alright to be honest may not be awake then but hopefully I’ll catch you still on. I’ll show some support as you have for me.,1
uyzxg6,ia7yyqy,devishjack,1653674684.0,"Thanks! When I was working on it, I always meant to go back and add a bridge in place of the pre-hook (the distorted vocals saying ""back and forth don't look back"") but sadly lost the project files before I could.

I've been heavy into experimental rap recently and this song was actually made after I heard Denzel Curry's song Zatoichi. Still trying to find a sound that's completely my own but I def feel like this song has been a step in the right direction.

Thanks for the feedback and I hope you have a great day.",1

uyzxg6,iaf1di6,sadboyleto2,1653825121.0,"yo bro thanks for the feedback. I asked my friend to shoot it for me cause she has an Iphone 13 lol the cinematic mode is blessed

I edited it though, was my first ""real"" edit so i'm pretty happy with the result but hoping to get better ones in the near future

How about gritty and raw though, in terms of mixing what would you recommend to change/add?",1
uyzxg6,iac4ptd,jakesboy2,1653760614.0,"I appreciate the kind words bro. I 100% feel you on the depth. I have a couple songs in progress for this album then it’s dropping soon, and my next album my big focus is going to be really stepping that portion up. 

  If you really wanna hear more, here’s the rest of the album in progress. It’s 2 songs left to get on there and some skits, then some clean up on some of the mixes. I do all my own beats and mixes so the big focus this album was stepping up in those two catagories.

It’s a story of an evil dictators last days on his way to getting caught. It also kinda dense with words. Lyrics on the page…
