129sdst,jeoywt8,dancetoken,1680462168.0,"The best is - They steal your shit and release it themselves. Your beat/song was so heat that they sacrificed the friendship for it.

good thread. my girl be dancing to all my beats. Shes not a 90s hip hop heads. but she'll be grooving to my dark 90s shit lol, i like the encouragement. Pianos can sound real shitty and muddy coming from a mac speaker, and she did say 'why does it sound so bad' ... so i do appreciate that she can keep it real sometimes. Gonna have to ask her to keep it realer ... cause my perception of my beats may not be realistic",27
129sdst,jeq7czl,No-Bed-5076,1680481883.0,Bro did you make this post? Is this you?,10
129sdst,jeqtqns,Sativa_Dreams,1680492614.0,"idk… this all kinda BS. dont get me wrong friends will usually bullshit you, thats how it is lol. but i have a wide variety of friends who react in a wide variety of ways. people who seem disinterested or only reply “dope” doesnt mean anything lol. people are different and have social quirks. i have homies who are closet listeners who never said more than a word or two to me who i find out has like 100 plays per song on their “on repeat” playlist, and some that like all my posts, share all my stories, bump my music when im in the car with them, are the least supportive.

tl;dr… dont use this random post to judge the type of person your friends are lol",15
129sdst,jepq3cg,SubstantialProject81,1680473838.0,"I don’t look that deep into it. I’m past the point of caring whether people like my shit or even listen to it, i just put shit out there for myself to enjoy i don’t push my shit how i used to bc i don’t crave validation like how i used to when i first started.",16

129sdst,jepv0f2,Shirairyu69,1680476120.0,I'm saving this for future reference. Thanks you for this service,4
129sdst,jerkxq0,digitaldisgust,1680513034.0,"Some of these are just inaccurate, you also need to factor in how the said person talks and tends to communicate with you.

I'd much rather get the love from people overseas bc I know my city/country's scene is not gonna embrace my type of sound.

Earl Sweatshirt is a living example of this lol, if he had stayed here in SA instead of where he was at in LA - he would have never met Tyler or blew up how he did.

If somebody from France or NY says they're feeling me then I KNOW I just did sumn lol.",4
129sdst,jerl86l,digitaldisgust,1680513314.0,"This seems mostly male-centric because as a woman, my homegirls are not gonna bust out into saying ""That's tough"" like they're Solluminati 😭",4

129sdst,jeqsfmx,Raymond_Stanz,1680491904.0,"I know I’m and will never be Drake. I just thought the people close to me would work to give encouragement. Like say SOMETHING to encourage me further. It’s not about the product, its about the act of expression. Its about taking the risk. I mean if ifs objectively awful, fine… but I don’t think I would share it if I believed it was?

Anyway, yeah 100 percent to this post. I honestly think some people are secretly jealous of the hobby and creativity.",3
129sdst,jesef9q,Slimxshadyx,1680531489.0,Don’t use this post lol. Someone talking about their favourite part of a song doesn’t mean they hate the rest of it wtf lol,3

129sdst,jepgt7q,,1680469745.0,"I don’t even ask my friends to listen to my shit anymore because they either flat out don’t reply, or send a heart emoji when I send it to their inbox. I’ll get the occasional “damn bro you snapped” but that’s about it.

Edit: I get more love from out of state and overseas than I ever do locally and it’s always been this way. From a small town on the Ohio/West Virginia border so me even considering knowledgeable/respectable feedback is kind of like a catch 22. But I’ve been doing this so long I’ve heard everything from “this is absolutely terrible” to “bro you’re one of the best lyricists I’ve ever heard no cap”",2

129sdst,jerwvq0,cotch85,1680522398.0,"I got one bit of feedback that was “this is really good, I can see it in the background of a tv show”

Can you decipher whether the last part changes the positive? It was a house track not anything cinematic",2

129sdst,jes4arm,jml011,1680526635.0,"Friendly reminder that you shouldn’t really be tapping your family and friends for feedback (unless they’re music makers themselves). Obviously share it with them, but most aren’t aren’t in position to be both honest and insightful, so you aren’t likely to get legitimate feedback.

129sdst,jet0y8x,LuderSutDiller,1680540741.0,Hmmm I can see why you wanted to make this post but alot of the statements are extremely subjective. Like someone can say the worst ones of those and actually enjoy it alot,2

129sdst,jez3sra,BBKucci,1680645659.0,"My friends are trying to make it in the rap game, so every time I listen to a new beat or a new tune they have I pick my words very carefully because I dont like to make negative comments. Its always better to point the good parts and try to be positive in the way I comment on the bad/not good parts. 
Who the fuck changes the subject right after listening to their friends' music? Get rid of people who dont care enough about you, it will be better.",1

129sdst,jep0h1m,Frank_Von_Tittyfuck,1680462829.0,"damn that’s tough to hear someone was willing to sacrifice a friendship for a song that probably didn’t even blow up. And benefit of the doubt, maybe it may just be your monitoring system. i blew out one of my mac speakers so now anytime i play anything back with low end it sounds like shit hahaha. speakers helped fix that",2
129sdst,jeqf043,YoitsPsilo,1680485390.0,"I feel this heavy! Sometimes I’ll make a beat and see my girl headnod and she doesn’t listen to hiphop at all so that’s all the validation I need at this point lol.

129sdst,jes4yjq,Frank_Von_Tittyfuck,1680526983.0,lmaooo yeah honestly I can’t really speak on female-centric reactions because 99% of the people I show it to are guys either in music or in my friend group. You know they be more animated and vocally turnt with their reactions though if they really genuinely fuck with it. I guess you could say the equivalent of “You made this/this you??!” in that sense would be something along the lines of “Biiitch?!?” or “Stop playin!!”,2

129sdst,jer6zzn,Sativa_Dreams,1680500919.0,"no you’re right. i just was giving examples and my comment was already long enough without me having to put a bunch of info nobody cares about in. i had a falling out with a friend who always gassed me up like i said in my comment and found out from his ex girlfriend who he lived with when we kicked it a lot, that he talked hella shit on me behind my back basically every time i left the house.

it later devolved into even worse shit than that but ya. he was a huge huge hater. thats what i mean. this post is silly. you shouldnt judge anyone based on their reactions, or even worse apply cookie cutter template reactions made up by OP and judge your friends based on that lol

just take it at face value until you have a reason not to",3
