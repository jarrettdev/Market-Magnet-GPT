z6e2u9,iy0x2qv,fightthesevampires,1669587812.0,Routenote is excellent. They are free in the sense that they take 15% of the streaming income instead of a fee.,24
z6e2u9,iy0zle3,logyonthebeat,1669588904.0,Just pay for distrokid especially if you Collab with a lot of people it's worth the money and convenience,6
z6e2u9,iy1bw3o,sampletopia,1669594286.0,I went bandcamp only last year and it was the best decision.,6
z6e2u9,iy0xlc7,EBWPro,1669588039.0,Amuse and freshtune for sure,9

Symphonic looks really good. 

Great reviews, comparable percentage split, distribution to EVERYWHERE ( which a lot of the freebies lack), split sheets and an optional uprade for $20 a year that removes percentages and improves some services. 

You do have to apply but Here's the breakdown.

z6e2u9,iy0vmfc,theride5,1669587193.0,I used Amuse free service before and they pay on time every month.,8

z6e2u9,iy1807r,flygxn,1669592579.0,"try turning your music into an nft and distribute it to anyone that wants it, you can use gamestop wallet to carry them around",2
z6e2u9,iy2jzbe,tracco_cs,1669617772.0,trac.co is the best distribution platform out there!,1

z6e2u9,iy11pls,SlimG89,1669589819.0,"Yes distrokid works great for what I have been doing and the splits are amazing and easy to do

I plan to use the FREE service to release music under a group name, and I would have to upgrade my current Distrokid plan to do that

I realize thats probably the best option, but I figured it couldnt hurt to see what peoples experiences have been with the FREE services",7

z6e2u9,iy4tnm1,NoahWall,1669663790.0,I have no experience with it. Do you need to do your best to get people to find your music or is there some that people can find it on their own (like Spotify radio or discover),2

z6e2u9,iy2jszi,tracco_cs,1669617640.0,"Try using trac.co, you can have as many artist accounts as you want all under one platform. There‚Äôs a Free plan & a paid plan ($60/year). The paid plan is actually cheaper than Distrokid all in, meaning there‚Äôs no extra charge for YouTube Content ID nor anything else they upsell, it‚Äôs all included in the plan.",4
z6e2u9,iy2lmqw,Sky_Hawk105,1669619044.0,I use Distrokid for solo releases as well as Amuse for any group stuff,3

They both do everything you need from a business perspective for the fee. üçª",2

z6e2u9,iy0va5d,SlimG89,1669587049.0,"Lol did you read the post? I‚Äôm wanting to release new music with my collaborator under a group name 

To do this on Distrokid it requires an upgraded account, which yes if I have to I will do that, but I‚Äôm wanting to hear peoples experiences with the FREE services 

You don‚Äôt have experience with any FREE service but thanks for the comment",7
z6e2u9,iy2t8el,walkedinthewoods,1669625454.0,"you have to have an upgraded account on Distrokid to release music under a different name? that's absolutely insane. back when Soundrop was free, I used that and it was great, but they became paid last year, so I switched over to Routenote, which has been even better. so that's definitely where my recommendation goes.",1
