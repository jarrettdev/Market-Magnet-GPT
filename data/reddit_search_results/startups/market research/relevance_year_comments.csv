yimqff,iujf0hw,The_Startup_CTO,1667246060.0,You say that you already have market fit due to speaking to several YouTubers. Sell them the product and ensure that they are actually willing to pay for it. Worry about further marketing after that.,27
yimqff,iujlbjw,social-media-is-bad,1667248622.0,"I think the time to collect emails was before you started writing code. If the code is almost ready then release what you have and get users. The goal is presumably to get paying users, not to get email addresses. So do the thing that gets you closer to what you want.",7
yimqff,iuk929s,Yo_Mr_White_,1667259363.0,"Not to be a hater but you don't have product-market-fit until you have people handing you money for your SaaS and those customers don't churn. People telling you they like your product isn't PMF at all. Money talks. 

&#x200B;

I think your number one goal right now isn't to grow but to validate your PMF. Figure out who are your most desperate costumers; sign up several of them in cohorts via paid ads or some other source; track their usage - see what % churns; iterate until your SaaS until you have fewer and fewer people churning each time. Then, you grow because you have PMF bc you know have a version of your SaaS that users don't seem to churn from.",7

yimqff,iukjawk,Old_Kikiko,1667264183.0,Sounds interesting. How did you get to speak and engage with these YouTubers?,1
yimqff,iul2z4p,Altruistic-Disk-9303,1667273875.0,Can you send me a chat with more info on the product? Maybe the website? Interested in checking it out.,1
yimqff,iuls6el,,1667294318.0,Whats your budget and expertise?,1
yimqff,iultq9o,sharkhacks_,1667295727.0,"Fast forward into the future, imagine that your product is launched, How are you ultimately planning to sell the product? Who are your target customers? where can you find them? are they willing to buy / invest in this without a trial? do you need a demo?  I would use the 'real' way you are planning to sell this, as your launch strategy. This way you can test your sales and marketing channels now. In fact I'd argue that you should have done this as step 1 before even investing in building anything. However it sounds like you have done market research and talked to some customers which is great.",1
yimqff,iumo3hj,liuro123,1667313147.0,"You say you've gotten in touch with with several YouTubers, that's great! Get at least 100 more (ask them for intros to their YouTubing-friends) and get their feedback and keep them in the loop until you launch. Then see how many would be willing to pay for your service.

Remember that marketing is a grind!",1
yimqff,iumtb60,h-educate,1667315306.0,"I think you should start building your email list , and make something special for early users.

then after launch, you should put a full marketing strategy:

1. Blogging
2. YouTube
3. Courses
4. Influencer Marketing
5. Paid Ads
6. Content Marketing
7. SEO
8. Free Tools and Side Projects",1
yimqff,iunrto8,ellie_hayden,1667328593.0,"Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages. You may stimulate interest in your product and collect contact information from potential customers by having them sign up in advance. On the other hand, there will be fewer people using your product at launch, which could slow your expansion.  
However, if you release your SAAS to a smaller population first, you may use that information to improve the product before promoting it to a bigger audience. On the other hand, if your intended audience believes that the product isn't yet fully developed or doesn't live up to their expectations, this approach may diminish their initial enthusiasm.  
Your business objectives and your estimation of what will be most productive in terms of user acquisition and revenue generation will determine the optimal approach.",1

yimqff,iuoc37e,EmergencySprinkles41,1667336222.0,"If its a YouTube tool, then maybe contact the Youtubers directly and see if they signup? There are also content creator communities such as VidiQ and TubeBuddy.",1
yimqff,ivd5vcd,WillC-47,1667787406.0,I would have advised you start your marketing campaign before any attempt at developing an MVP. Should get a good email list built up so you have that guarantee of clients/customers before launch.,1
