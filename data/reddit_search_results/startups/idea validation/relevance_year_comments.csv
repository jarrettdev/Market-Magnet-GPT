Demos, get feedback, iterate. 

When a customer says yes I’ll buy… spend the money and get GDPR and SOC 2 compliant.",3
u2pmuk,i4lpvas,p13er,1649876911.0,Try [mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/) if you need to create data for demo,3
u2pmuk,i4k8i2q,QdevelopR,1649855974.0,"I unserstood the situation but i couldnt get the problem. Would u please explain the problem more clearly? 
I understood your problem as; Your mvp can automate the data process its ok. But because of the GDPR you couldn’t reach or process their data right?",2
u2pmuk,i4ki7gw,shaft_of_gold,1649860137.0,"When I go looking for specific software solutions for my business customers I always ask for a demo with dummy data so I can play with it and see how it works.

After playing with demo data and being satisfied that the software does what it says it does, I then typically setup a test environment using my customers data so they can play with it (this test environment usually then hangs around so their employees can be trained on it)

Most B2B niche solutions offer these kinds of options in my experience, so my recommendation is to grab a whole bunch of data and anonymize it and use that as your demo/MVP/sales tool",2
u2pmuk,i4m3q7p,Reddit-1-account,1649882570.0,"I'm starting a legal tech company. You need to demo using a made up data set, or if you have first hand experience, use your own data.

Once you've demonstrated value, you can do a 2 week free trial or something (basically process their data for free) and then go to something paid.",2
u2pmuk,i4o7gzf,lez566,1649920016.0,PM me. I’ve built a solution for exactly this space and done what you’re trying to do.,1
u2pmuk,i4k8hcy,TarisLoud,1649855965.0,"Hi, thanks for your reply.   


This would generally be the way I'd be getting feedback, however 'what' to show is the issue. Its hard to show a data platform's capabilities without the data, if you get my drift.",1
u2pmuk,i4p8l0o,TarisLoud,1649944539.0,Now that is a very good tool! Thanks for posting it!,1
u2pmuk,i4k9o78,TarisLoud,1649856510.0,"The platform pulls data from customers other software. As I'm validating this MVP I need to show what it can do, which means I need the customers data to demonstrate its function. I'm approaching these customers and saying ""I've got a product that solve your data reporting, you just need to give me access to your data to show you how it works"".   


The data is generally sensitive in nature, so you can see why they might be hesitant to hand over their API keys to a guy with just a landing page and product demo, right? That's the problem; if getting access to the data is a hurdle, how do I validate a data product with no data?",1
u2pmuk,i4klzzg,TarisLoud,1649861630.0,Thanks for your reply! Using false data is sounding more and more like the way forward.,1
u2pmuk,i4p7yqe,TarisLoud,1649944272.0,"The 2 weeks part is interesting, that's something I had considered. Thanks for the insight!",1
u2pmuk,i4p8i9b,TarisLoud,1649944507.0,"Interested in your solution. Its a fairly generic problem and there's a lot of open source tools out there that does this exact thing, but always interested to see more tools that can achieve it.",1
u2pmuk,i4k9175,auspex,1649856216.0,"Set up a demo system that integrates with your own instances of whatever.

Spend a few days generating fake but “reasonable” looking data. 

You just need enough so it looks populated and people can mentally overlay their data onto what you’re showing.",2
u2pmuk,i4kn99b,shaft_of_gold,1649862129.0,"No problems!

If it was me, I would take a ""vertical slice"" and have comprehensive dummy data for a few things (eg 10ish fake users with full history / all possible data points filled out on whatever it is the data dump should be mimicking). 

Oh also when I'm testing things, I click and fiddle with every slider, checkbox, text field, minimise and print button there is on the screen!",1
u2pmuk,i4k9zq1,TarisLoud,1649856656.0,"That's what I'm thinking is the alternative. Thanks for the insight!  


Also SOC 2 looks interesting, I'm very familiar with GDPR but SOC 2 looks like a decent accreditation outside of cyber essentials in the UK.",1
